a sample rate of 44.1 khz is almost always used , because this is also used for cd audio , the main source used for creating mp3 files . a greater variety of bit rates are used on the internet . the rate of 128 kbit/s is commonly used , at a compression ratio of 11:1 , offering adequate audio quality in a relatively small space . as internet bandwidth availability and hard drive sizes have increased , higher bit rates up to 320 kbit/s are widespread .
the epidermis is typically 10 to 30 cells thick ; its main function is to provide a waterproof layer . its outermost cells are constantly lost ; its bottommost cells are constantly dividing and pushing upward . the middle layer , the dermis , is 15 to 40 times thicker than the epidermis . the dermis is made up of many components , such as bony structures and blood vessels . the hypodermis is made up of adipose tissue . its job is to store lipids , and to provide cushioning and insulation . the thickness of this layer varies widely from species to species .
all protestant denominations reject the notion of papal supremacy over the church universal and generally deny the roman catholic doctrine of transubstantiation , but they disagree among themselves regarding the real presence of christ in the eucharist . the various denominations generally emphasize the priesthood of all believers , the doctrine of justification by faith alone ( sola fide ) rather than by or with good works , and a belief in the bible alone ( rather than with catholic tradition ) as the highest authority in matters of faith and morals ( sola scriptura ) . the " five solae " summarize the reformers ' basic differences in theological beliefs in opposition to the teaching of the roman catholic church of the day .

the railroads opened up the great plains for settlement , for now it was possible to ship wheat and other crops at low cost to the urban markets in the east , and europe . homestead land was free for american settlers . railroads sold their land at cheap rates to immigrants in expectation they would generate traffic as soon as farms were established . immigrants poured in , especially from germany and scandinavia . on the plains , very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch by themselves ; they clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife , and numerous children , to handle the many chores , including child-rearing , feeding and clothing the family , managing the housework , feeding the hired hands , and , especially after the 1930s , handling paperwork and financial details . during the early years of settlement , farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors . after approximately one generation , women increasingly left the fields , thus redefining their roles within the family . new technology including sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles . the scientific housekeeping movement , promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents , as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning , advice columns for women regarding farm bookkeeping , and home economics courses in the schools .
jesus ' death and resurrection underpin a variety of theological interpretations as to how salvation is granted to humanity . these interpretations vary widely in how much emphasis they place on the death of jesus as compared to his words . according to the substitutionary atonement view , jesus ' death is of central importance , and jesus willingly sacrificed himself as an act of perfect obedience as a sacrifice of love which pleased god . by contrast the moral influence theory of atonement focuses much more on the moral content of jesus ' teaching , and sees jesus ' death as a martyrdom . since the middle ages there has been conflict between these two views within western christianity . evangelical protestants typically hold a substitutionary view and in particular hold to the theory of penal substitution . liberal protestants typically reject substitutionary atonement and hold to the moral influence theory of atonement . both views are popular within the roman catholic church , with the satisfaction doctrine incorporated into the idea of penance .
the russian sfsr was controlled by the communist party of the soviet union , until the abortive 1991 august coup , which prompted president yeltsin to suspend the recently created communist party of the russian soviet federative socialist republic .
the gospel of matthew describes many women at the crucifixion , some of whom are named in the gospels . apart from these women , the three synoptic gospels speak of the presence of others : " the chief priests , with the scribes and elders " ; two robbers crucified , one on jesus ' right and one on his left , whom the gospel of luke presents as the penitent thief and the impenitent thief ; " the soldiers " , " the centurion and those who were with him , keeping watch over jesus " ; passers-by ; " bystanders " , " the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle " ; and " his acquaintances "
from the 9th century , the pecheneg nomads began an uneasy relationship with kievan rus′ . for over two centuries they launched sporadic raids into the lands of rus′ , which sometimes escalated into full-scale wars ( such as the 920 war on the pechenegs by igor of kiev reported in the primary chronicle ) , but there were also temporary military alliances ( e.g . the 943 byzantine campaign by igor ) . in 968 , the pechenegs attacked and besieged the city of kiev . some speculation exists that the pechenegs drove off the tivertsi and the ulichs to the regions of the upper dniester river in bukovina . the byzantine empire was known to support the pechenegs in their military campaigns against the eastern slavic states .

popper puzzled over the stark contrast between the non-scientific character of freud and adler 's theories in the field of psychology and the revolution set off by einstein 's theory of relativity in physics in the early 20th century . popper thought that einstein 's theory , as a theory properly grounded in scientific thought and method , was highly " risky " , in the sense that it was possible to deduce consequences from it which were , in the light of the then-dominant newtonian physics , highly improbable ( e.g. , that light is deflected towards solid bodies—confirmed by eddington 's experiments in 1919 ) , and which would , if they turned out to be false , falsify the whole theory . in contrast , nothing could , even in principle , falsify psychoanalytic theories . he thus came to the conclusion that psychoanalytic theories had more in common with primitive myths than with genuine science .
since whitehead 's metaphysics described a universe in which all entities experience , he needed a new way of describing perception that was not limited to living , self-conscious beings . the term he coined was " prehension " , which comes from the latin prehensio , meaning " to seize . " the term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious , applying to people as well as electrons . it is also intended to make clear whitehead 's rejection of the theory of representative perception , in which the mind only has private ideas about other entities . for whitehead , the term " prehension " indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself . in this way , entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations , rather than being independent of them . further , whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes , causal efficacy ( or " physical prehension " ) and presentational immediacy ( or " conceptual prehension " ) .
however , samoans greatly resented new zealand 's colonial rule , and blamed inflation and the catastrophic 1918 flu epidemic on its misrule . by the late 1920s the resistance movement against colonial rule had gathered widespread support . one of the mau leaders was olaf frederick nelson , a half samoan and half swedish merchant . nelson was eventually exiled during the late 1920s and early 1930s , but he continued to assist the organisation financially and politically . in accordance with the mau 's non-violent philosophy , the newly elected leader , high chief tupua tamasese lealofi , led his fellow uniformed mau in a peaceful demonstration in downtown apia on 28 december 1929 .
chemical communications in animals rely on a variety of aspects including taste and smell . chemoreception is the physiological response of a sense organ ( i.e . taste or smell ) to a chemical stimulus where the chemicals act as signals to regulate the state or activity of a cell . a semiochemical is a message-carrying chemical that is meant to attract , repel , and convey information . types of semiochemicals include pheromones and kairomones . one example is the butterfly phengaris arion which uses chemical signals as a form of mimicry to aid in predation .

the prussian army , under the terms of the armistice , held a brief victory parade in paris on 17 february ; the city was silent and draped with black and the germans quickly withdrew . bismarck honoured the armistice , by allowing train loads of food into paris and withdrawing prussian forces to the east of the city , prior to a full withdrawal once france agreed to pay a five billion franc war indemnity . at the same time , prussian forces were concentrated in the provinces of alsace and lorraine . an exodus occurred from paris as some 200,000 people , predominantly middle-class , went to the countryside .
canada has the world 's largest deposit of natural bitumen in the athabasca oil sands and canadian first nations along the athabasca river had long used it to waterproof their canoes . in 1719 , a cree indian named wa-pa-su brought a sample for trade to henry kelsey of the hudson ’ s bay company , who was the first recorded european to see it . however , it was n't until 1787 that fur trader and explorer alexander mackenzie saw the athabasca oil sands and said , " at about 24 miles from the fork ( of the athabasca and clearwater rivers ) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of 20 feet long may be inserted without the least resistance . "
the english word " translation " derives from the latin translatio ( which itself comes from trans- and from fero , the supine form of which is latum—together meaning " a carrying across " or " a bringing across " ) . the modern romance languages use equivalents of the english term " translation " that are derived from that same latin source or from the alternative latin traducere ( " to lead across " or " to bring across " ) . the slavic and germanic languages ( except in the case of the dutch equivalent , " vertaling " —a " re-language-ing " ) likewise use calques of these latin sources .
universities created by bilateral or multilateral treaties between states are intergovernmental . an example is the academy of european law , which offers training in european law to lawyers , judges , barristers , solicitors , in-house counsel and academics . euclid ( pôle universitaire euclide , euclid university ) is chartered as a university and umbrella organisation dedicated to sustainable development in signatory countries , and the united nations university engages in efforts to resolve the pressing global problems that are of concern to the united nations , its peoples and member states . the european university institute , a post-graduate university specialised in the social sciences , is officially an intergovernmental organisation , set up by the member states of the european union .
the higher-level phylogeny of the arthropods continues to be a matter of debate and research . in 2008 , researchers at tufts university uncovered what they believe is the world 's oldest known full-body impression of a primitive flying insect , a 300 million-year-old specimen from the carboniferous period . the oldest definitive insect fossil is the devonian rhyniognatha hirsti , from the 396-million-year-old rhynie chert . it may have superficially resembled a modern-day silverfish insect . this species already possessed dicondylic mandibles ( two articulations in the mandible ) , a feature associated with winged insects , suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time . thus , the first insects probably appeared earlier , in the silurian period .
the power of parliament to pass bills was often thwarted by monarchs . charles i dissolved parliament in 1629 , after it passed motions critical of and bills seeking to restrict his arbitrary exercise of power . during the eleven years of personal rule that followed , charles performed legally dubious actions , such as raising taxes without parliament 's approval . after the english civil war , it was accepted that parliament should be summoned to meet regularly , but it was still commonplace for monarchs to refuse royal assent to bills . in 1678 , charles ii withheld his assent from a bill " for preserving the peace of the kingdom by raising the militia , and continuing them in duty for two and forty days , " suggesting that he , not parliament , should control the militia . the last stuart monarch , anne , similarly withheld on 11 march 1708 , on the advice of her ministers , her assent from a bill for the settling of militia in scotland . no monarch has since withheld royal assent on a bill passed by the british parliament .
height limits in the melbourne cbd were lifted in 1958 , after the construction of ici house , transforming the city 's skyline with the introduction of skyscrapers . suburban expansion then intensified , serviced by new indoor malls beginning with chadstone shopping centre . the post-war period also saw a major renewal of the cbd and st kilda road which significantly modernised the city . new fire regulations and redevelopment saw most of the taller pre-war cbd buildings either demolished or partially retained through a policy of facadism . many of the larger suburban mansions from the boom era were also either demolished or subdivided .
players may only be transferred during transfer windows that are set by the football association . the two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 august and from 31 december to 31 january . player registrations can not be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the fa , usually on an emergency basis . as of the 2010–11 season , the premier league introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21 , with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances . this was to enable the 'home grown ' rule to be enacted , whereby the league would also from 2010 require at least 8 of the named 25 man squad to be made up of 'home-grown players ' .
several political figures who served as zhejiang 's top political office of communist party secretary have played key roles in various events in prc history . tan zhenlin ( term 1949-1952 ) , the inaugural party secretary , was one of the leading voices against mao 's cultural revolution during the so-called february countercurrent of 1967 . jiang hua ( term 1956-1968 ) , was the " chief justice " on the special court in the case against the gang of four in 1980 . three provincial party secretaries since the 1990s have gone onto prominence at the national level . they include cpc general secretary and president xi jinping ( term 2002-2007 ) , national people 's congress chairman and former vice-premier zhang dejiang ( term 1998-2002 ) , and zhao hongzhu ( term 2007-2012 ) , the deputy secretary of the central commission for discipline inspection , china 's top anti-corruption body . of zhejiang 's fourteen party secretaries since 1949 , none were native to the province .
the massive work was arranged according to a " tree of knowledge . " the tree reflected the marked division between the arts and sciences , which was largely a result of the rise of empiricism . both areas of knowledge were united by philosophy , or the trunk of the tree of knowledge . the enlightenment 's desacrilization of religion was pronounced in the tree 's design , particularly where theology accounted for a peripheral branch , with black magic as a close neighbour . as the encyclopédie gained popularity , it was published in quarto and octavo editions after 1777 . the quarto and octavo editions were much less expensive than previous editions , making the encyclopédie more accessible to the non-elite . robert darnton estimates that there were approximately 25 000 copies of the encyclopédie in circulation throughout france and europe before the french revolution . the extensive , yet affordable encyclopedia came to represent the transmission of enlightenment and scientific education to an expanding audience .
by the middle ages , large numbers of jews lived in the holy roman empire and had assimilated into german culture , including many jews who had previously assimilated into french culture and had spoken a mixed judeo-french language . upon assimilating into german culture , the jewish german peoples incorporated major parts of the german language and elements of other european languages into a mixed language known as yiddish . however tolerance and assimilation of jews in german society suddenly ended during the crusades with many jews being forcefully expelled from germany and western yiddish disappeared as a language in germany over the centuries , with german jewish people fully adopting the german language .
the required beliefs of these clauses include belief in a supreme being and belief in a future state of rewards and punishments . ( tennessee constitution article ix , section 2 is one such example . ) some of these same states specify that the oath of office include the words " so help me god . " in some cases these beliefs ( or oaths ) were historically required of jurors and witnesses in court . at one time , such restrictions were allowed under the doctrine of states ' rights ; today they are deemed to be in violation of the federal first amendment , as applied to the states via the 14th amendment , and hence unconstitutional and unenforceable .
during the napoleonic occupation of spain , miguel hidalgo y costilla , a catholic priest of progressive ideas , declared mexican independence in the small town of dolores , guanajuato on september 16 , 1810 with a proclamation known as the " grito de dolores " . hidalgo built a large support among intellectuals , liberal priests and many poor people . hidalgo fought to protect the rights of the poor and indigenous population . he started on a march to the capital , mexico city , but retreated back north when faced with the elite of the royal forces at the outskirts of the capital . he established a liberal government from guadalajara , jalisco but was soon forced to flee north by the royal forces that recaptured the city . hidalgo attempted to reach the united states and gain american support for mexican independence . hidalgo reached saltillo , coahuila where he publicly resigned his military post and rejected a pardon offered by viceroy francisco venegas in return for hidalgo 's surrender . a short time later , he and his supporters were captured by royalist ignacio elizondo at the wells of baján ( norias de baján ) on march 21 , 1811 and taken to the city of chihuahua . hidalgo forced the bishop of valladolid , manuel abad y queipo , to rescind the excommunication order he had circulated against him on september 24 , 1810 . later , the inquisition issued an excommunication edict on october 13 , 1810 condemning miguel hidalgo as a seditionary , apostate , and heretic .
most electrification systems use overhead wires , but third rail is an option up to about 1,200 v. third rail systems exclusively use dc distribution . the use of ac is not feasible because the dimensions of a third rail are physically very large compared with the skin depth that the alternating current penetrates to ( 0.3 millimetres or 0.012 inches ) in a steel rail ) . this effect makes the resistance per unit length unacceptably high compared with the use of dc . third rail is more compact than overhead wires and can be used in smaller-diameter tunnels , an important factor for subway systems .
in january 2002 , the u.s. sent more than 1,200 troops ( later raised to 2,000 ) to assist the armed forces of the philippines in combating terrorist groups linked to al-qaida , such as abu sayyaf , under operation enduring freedom - philippines . operations have taken place mostly in the sulu archipelago , where terrorists and other groups are active . the majority of troops provide logistics . however , there are special forces troops that are training and assisting in combat operations against the terrorist groups .

the conversion rate of omega-6 dgla to aa largely determines the production of the prostaglandins pge1 and pge2 . omega-3 epa prevents aa from being released from membranes , thereby skewing prostaglandin balance away from pro-inflammatory pge2 ( made from aa ) toward anti-inflammatory pge1 ( made from dgla ) . moreover , the conversion ( desaturation ) of dgla to aa is controlled by the enzyme delta-5-desaturase , which in turn is controlled by hormones such as insulin ( up-regulation ) and glucagon ( down-regulation ) . the amount and type of carbohydrates consumed , along with some types of amino acid , can influence processes involving insulin , glucagon , and other hormones ; therefore , the ratio of omega-3 versus omega-6 has wide effects on general health , and specific effects on immune function and inflammation , and mitosis ( i.e. , cell division ) .
since 2001 , miami has been undergoing a large building boom with more than 50 skyscrapers rising over 400 feet ( 122 m ) built or currently under construction in the city . miami 's skyline is ranked third-most impressive in the u.s. , behind new york city and chicago , and 19th in the world according to the almanac of architecture and design . the city currently has the eight tallest ( as well as thirteen of the fourteen tallest ) skyscrapers in the state of florida , with the tallest being the 789-foot ( 240 m ) four seasons hotel & tower .
beginning with immanuel kant , german idealists such as g. w. f. hegel , johann gottlieb fichte , friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling , and arthur schopenhauer dominated 19th-century philosophy . this tradition , which emphasized the mental or " ideal " character of all phenomena , gave birth to idealistic and subjectivist schools ranging from british idealism to phenomenalism to existentialism . the historical influence of this branch of idealism remains central even to the schools that rejected its metaphysical assumptions , such as marxism , pragmatism and positivism .
the rose garden ( rosengarten ) , from which a scenic panoramic view of the medieval town centre can be enjoyed , is a well-kept rosarium on a hill , converted into a park from a former cemetery in 1913 .
philadelphia gas works ( pgw ) , overseen by the pennsylvania public utility commission , is the nation 's largest municipally owned natural gas utility . it serves over 500,000 homes and businesses in the philadelphia area . founded in 1836 , the company came under city ownership in 1987 and has been providing the majority of gas distributed within city limits . in 2014 , the philadelphia city council refused to conduct hearings on a $ 1.86 billion sale of pgw , part of a two-year effort that was proposed by the mayor . the refusal led to the prospective buyer terminating its offer .
when it turned out that there would not be enough uranium-235 to make more than one bomb , the implosive lens project was greatly expanded and von neumann 's idea was implemented . implosion was the only method that could be used with the plutonium-239 that was available from the hanford site . he established the design of the explosive lenses required , but there remained concerns about " edge effects " and imperfections in the explosives . his calculations showed that implosion would work if it did not depart by more than 5 % from spherical symmetry . after a series of failed attempts with models , this was achieved by george kistiakowsky , and the construction of the trinity bomb was completed in july 1945 .
as the kulluk oil rig was being towed to the american state of washington to be serviced in preparation for the 2013 drilling season , a winter storm on 27 december 2012 caused the towing crews , as well as the rescue service , to lose control of the situation . as of 1 january 2013 , the kulluk was grounded off the coast sitkalidak island , near the eastern end of kodiak island . following the accident , a fortune magazine contacted larry mckinney , the executive director at the harte research institute for gulf of mexico studies at texas a & m , and he explained that " a two-month delay in the arctic is not a two-month delay ... a two-month delay could wipe out the entire drilling season . "
proteins are structural materials in much of the animal body ( e.g . muscles , skin , and hair ) . they also form the enzymes that control chemical reactions throughout the body . each protein molecule is composed of amino acids , which are characterized by inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulphur ( these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein , such as the keratin in hair ) . the body requires amino acids to produce new proteins ( protein retention ) and to replace damaged proteins ( maintenance ) . as there is no protein or amino acid storage provision , amino acids must be present in the diet . excess amino acids are discarded , typically in the urine . for all animals , some amino acids are essential ( an animal can not produce them internally ) and some are non-essential ( the animal can produce them from other nitrogen-containing compounds ) . about twenty amino acids are found in the human body , and about ten of these are essential and , therefore , must be included in the diet . a diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids ( especially those that are essential ) is particularly important in some situations : during early development and maturation , pregnancy , lactation , or injury ( a burn , for instance ) . a complete protein source contains all the essential amino acids ; an incomplete protein source lacks one or more of the essential amino acids .
milena sterio , american expert of international law , includes the former axis powers ( germany , italy and japan ) and india among the great powers along with the permanent members of the unsc . she considers germany , japan and italy to be great powers due to their g7 membership and because of their influence in regional and international organizations . various authors describe italy as an equal major power , while others view italy as an " intermittent great power " or as " the least of the great powers " .
westminster school and westminster abbey choir school are also in the precincts of the abbey . it was natural for the learned and literate monks to be entrusted with education , and benedictine monks were required by the pope to maintain a charity school in 1179 . the choir school educates and trains the choirboys who sing for services in the abbey .
the cubs enjoyed one more pennant at the close of world war ii , finishing 98–56 . due to the wartime travel restrictions , the first three games of the 1945 world series were played in detroit , where the cubs won two games , including a one-hitter by claude passeau , and the final four were played at wrigley . in game 4 of the series , the curse of the billy goat was allegedly laid upon the cubs when p.k . wrigley ejected billy sianis , who had come to game 4 with two box seat tickets , one for him and one for his goat . they paraded around for a few innings , but wrigley demanded the goat leave the park due to its unpleasant odor . upon his ejection , mr. sianis uttered , " the cubs , they ai n't gon na win no more . " the cubs lost game 4 , lost the series , and have not been back since . it has also been said by many that sianis put a " curse " on the cubs , apparently preventing the team from playing in the world series . after losing the 1945 world series to the detroit tigers , the cubs finished with winning seasons the next two years , but those teams did not enter post-season play .
epigenetic changes in eukaryotic biology serve to regulate the process of cellular differentiation . during morphogenesis , totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo , which in turn become fully differentiated cells . a single fertilized egg cell , the zygote , gives rise to the many different plant cell types including parenchyma , xylem vessel elements , phloem sieve tubes , guard cells of the epidermis , etc . as it continues to divide . the process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others .
television has played a major role in the history of the premier league . the league 's decision to assign broadcasting rights to bskyb in 1992 was at the time a radical decision , but one that has paid off . at the time pay television was an almost untested proposition in the uk market , as was charging fans to watch live televised football . however , a combination of sky 's strategy , the quality of premier league football and the public 's appetite for the game has seen the value of the premier league 's tv rights soar .

protestantism is a form of christian faith and practice which originated with the protestant reformation , [ a ] a movement against what its followers considered to be errors in the roman catholic church . it is one of the three major divisions of christendom , together with roman catholicism and eastern orthodoxy . anglicanism is sometimes considered to be independent from protestantism . [ b ] the term derives from the letter of protestation from lutheran princes in 1529 against an edict condemning the teachings of martin luther as heretical .
queen 's last album featuring mercury , titled made in heaven , was finally released in 1995 , four years after his death . featuring tracks such as " too much love will kill you " and " heaven for everyone " , it was constructed from mercury 's final recordings in 1991 , material left over from their previous studio albums and re-worked material from may , taylor , and mercury 's solo albums . the album also featured the song " mother love " , the last vocal recording mercury made prior to his death , which he completed using a drum machine , over which may , taylor and deacon later added the instrumental track . after completing the penultimate verse , mercury had told the band he " was n't feeling that great " and stated , " i will finish it when i come back , next time " ; however , he never made it back into the studio , so may later recorded the final verse of the song . both stages of recording , before and after mercury 's death , were completed at the band 's studio in montreux , switzerland . the album reached no . 1 on the uk charts immediately following its release , and has sold 20 million copies worldwide . on 25 november 1996 , a statue of mercury was unveiled in montreux overlooking lake geneva , almost five years to the day since his death .
congress has the sole power to legislate for the united states . under the nondelegation doctrine , congress may not delegate its lawmaking responsibilities to any other agency . in this vein , the supreme court held in the 1998 case clinton v. city of new york that congress could not delegate a " line-item veto " to the president , by powers vested in the government by the constitution .
the resulting treaty of schönbrunn in october 1809 was the harshest that france had imposed on austria in recent memory . metternich and archduke charles had the preservation of the habsburg empire as their fundamental goal , and to this end they succeeded by making napoleon seek more modest goals in return for promises of friendship between the two powers . nevertheless , while most of the hereditary lands remained a part of the habsburg realm , france received carinthia , carniola , and the adriatic ports , while galicia was given to the poles and the salzburg area of the tyrol went to the bavarians . austria lost over three million subjects , about one-fifth of her total population , as a result of these territorial changes . although fighting in iberia continued , the war of the fifth coalition would be the last major conflict on the european continent for the next three years .
usb data is transmitted by toggling the data lines between the j state and the opposite k state . usb encodes data using the nrzi line coding ; a 0 bit is transmitted by toggling the data lines from j to k or vice versa , while a 1 bit is transmitted by leaving the data lines as-is . to ensure a minimum density of signal transitions remains in the bitstream , usb uses bit stuffing ; an extra 0 bit is inserted into the data stream after any appearance of six consecutive 1 bits . seven consecutive received 1 bits is always an error . usb 3.0 has introduced additional data transmission encodings .
section 6 of the endangered species act provided funding for development of programs for management of threatened and endangered species by state wildlife agencies . subsequently , lists of endangered and threatened species within their boundaries have been prepared by each state . these state lists often include species which are considered endangered or threatened within a specific state but not within all states , and which therefore are not included on the national list of endangered and threatened species . examples include florida , minnesota , maine , and california .
the band have released a total of eighteen number one albums , eighteen number one singles , and ten number one dvds worldwide , making them one of the world 's best-selling music artists . queen have sold over 150 million records , with some estimates in excess of 300 million records worldwide , including 34.5 million albums in the us as of 2004 . inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in 2001 , the band is the only group in which every member has composed more than one chart-topping single , and all four members were inducted into the songwriters hall of fame in 2003 . in 2009 , " we will rock you " and " we are the champions " were inducted into the grammy hall of fame , and the latter was voted the world 's favourite song in a global music poll .
the criminal justice information services ( cjis ) division , is located in clarksburg , west virginia . organized beginning in 1991 , the office opened in 1995 as the youngest agency division . the complex is the length of three football fields . it provides a main repository for information in various data systems . under the roof of the cjis are the programs for the national crime information center ( ncic ) , uniform crime reporting ( ucr ) , fingerprint identification , integrated automated fingerprint identification system ( iafis ) , ncic 2000 , and the national incident-based reporting system ( nibrs ) . many state and local agencies use these data systems as a source for their own investigations and contribute to the database using secure communications . fbi provides these tools of sophisticated identification and information services to local , state , federal , and international law enforcement agencies .
the u.s. digital millennium copyright act ( 1998 ) and the european e-commerce directive ( 2000 ) provide online intermediaries with limited statutory immunity from liability for copyright infringement . online intermediaries hosting content that infringes copyright are not liable , so long as they do not know about it and take actions once the infringing content is brought to their attention . in u.s. law this is characterized as " safe harbor " provisions . under european law , the governing principles for internet service providers are " mere conduit " , meaning that they are neutral 'pipes ' with no knowledge of what they are carrying ; and 'no obligation to monitor ' meaning that they can not be given a general mandate by governments to monitor content . these two principles are a barrier for certain forms of online copyright enforcement and they were the reason behind an attempt to amend the european telecoms package in 2009 to support new measures against copyright infringement .
in 1948 , the point-contact transistor was independently invented by german physicists herbert mataré and heinrich welker while working at the compagnie des freins et signaux , a westinghouse subsidiary located in paris . mataré had previous experience in developing crystal rectifiers from silicon and germanium in the german radar effort during world war ii . using this knowledge , he began researching the phenomenon of " interference " in 1947 . by june 1948 , witnessing currents flowing through point-contacts , mataré produced consistent results using samples of germanium produced by welker , similar to what bardeen and brattain had accomplished earlier in december 1947 . realizing that bell labs ' scientists had already invented the transistor before them , the company rushed to get its " transistron " into production for amplified use in france 's telephone network .
in 1984 , he was appointed a member of the order of the companions of honour by queen elizabeth ii on the advice of prime minister margaret thatcher for his " services to the study of economics " . he was the first recipient of the hanns martin schleyer prize in 1984 . he also received the us presidential medal of freedom in 1991 from president george h. w. bush . in 2011 , his article " the use of knowledge in society " was selected as one of the top 20 articles published in the american economic review during its first 100 years .
cultural practices in the americas seem to have been shared mostly within geographical zones where unrelated peoples adopted similar technologies and social organizations . an example of such a cultural area is mesoamerica , where millennia of coexistence and shared development among the peoples of the region produced a fairly homogeneous culture with complex agricultural and social patterns . another well-known example is the north american plains where until the 19th century several peoples shared the traits of nomadic hunter-gatherers based primarily on buffalo hunting .
treaties formed an important part of european colonization and , in many parts of the world , europeans attempted to legitimize their sovereignty by signing treaties with indigenous peoples . in most cases these treaties were in extremely disadvantageous terms to the native people , who often did not appreciate the implications of what they were signing .
in 1903 , josiah white iii bought a parcel of land near ohio avenue and the boardwalk and built the queen anne style marlborough house . the hotel was a hit and , in 1905–06 , he chose to expand the hotel and bought another parcel of land next door to his marlborough house . in an effort to make his new hotel a source of conversation , white hired the architectural firm of price and mclanahan . the firm made use of reinforced concrete , a new building material invented by jean-louis lambot in 1848 ( joseph monier received the patent in 1867 ) . the hotel 's spanish and moorish themes , capped off with its signature dome and chimneys , represented a step forward from other hotels that had a classically designed influence . white named the new hotel the blenheim and merged the two hotels into the marlborough-blenheim . bally 's atlantic city was later constructed at this location .
san diego is one of the top-ten best climates in the farmers ' almanac and is one of the two best summer climates in america as scored by the weather channel . under the köppen–geiger climate classification system , the san diego area has been variously categorized as having either a semi-arid climate ( bsh in the original classification and bskn in modified köppen classification ) or a mediterranean climate ( csa and csb ) . san diego 's climate is characterized by warm , dry summers and mild winters with most of the annual precipitation falling between december and march . the city has a mild climate year-round , with an average of 201 days above 70 °f ( 21 °c ) and low rainfall ( 9–13 inches [ 230–330 mm ] annually ) . dewpoints in the summer months range from 57.0 °f ( 13.9 °c ) to 62.4 °f ( 16.9 °c ) .
on march 10 , 1876 , three days after his patent was issued , bell succeeded in getting his telephone to work , using a liquid transmitter similar to gray 's design . vibration of the diaphragm caused a needle to vibrate in the water , varying the electrical resistance in the circuit . when bell spoke the famous sentence " mr. watson—come here—i want to see you " into the liquid transmitter , watson , listening at the receiving end in an adjoining room , heard the words clearly .
tajikistan ( i/tɑːˈdʒiːkᵻstɑːn/ , /təˈdʒiːkᵻstæn/ , or /tæˈdʒiːkiːstæn/ ; persian : تاجيكستان‎‎ тоҷикистон [ tɔd͡ʒikɪsˈtɔn ] ) , officially the republic of tajikistan ( persian : جمهورى تاجيكستان‎‎ tajik : ҷумҳурии тоҷикистон , çumhuriji toçikiston/jumhuriyi tojikiston ; russian : респу́блика таджикистан , respublika tadzhikistan ) , is a mountainous , landlocked country in central asia with an estimated 8 million people in 2013 , and an area of 143,100 km2 ( 55,300 sq mi ) . it is bordered by afghanistan to the south , uzbekistan to the west , kyrgyzstan to the north , and china to the east . pakistan lies to the south , separated by the narrow wakhan corridor . traditional homelands of tajik people included present-day tajikistan , afghanistan and uzbekistan .
in 2000 , the fbi began the trilogy project to upgrade its outdated information technology ( it ) infrastructure . this project , originally scheduled to take three years and cost around $ 380 million , ended up going far over budget and behind schedule . efforts to deploy modern computers and networking equipment were generally successful , but attempts to develop new investigation software , outsourced to science applications international corporation ( saic ) , were not . virtual case file , or vcf , as the software was known , was plagued by poorly defined goals , and repeated changes in management . in january 2005 , more than two years after the software was originally planned for completion , the fbi officially abandoned the project . at least $ 100 million ( and much more by some estimates ) was spent on the project , which never became operational . the fbi has been forced to continue using its decade-old automated case support system , which it experts consider woefully inadequate . in march 2005 , the fbi announced it was beginning a new , more ambitious software project , code-named sentinel , which they expected to complete by 2009 .
thermodynamics divides energy transformation into two kinds : reversible processes and irreversible processes . an irreversible process is one in which energy is dissipated ( spread ) into empty energy states available in a volume , from which it can not be recovered into more concentrated forms ( fewer quantum states ) , without degradation of even more energy . a reversible process is one in which this sort of dissipation does not happen . for example , conversion of energy from one type of potential field to another , is reversible , as in the pendulum system described above . in processes where heat is generated , quantum states of lower energy , present as possible excitations in fields between atoms , act as a reservoir for part of the energy , from which it can not be recovered , in order to be converted with 100 % efficiency into other forms of energy . in this case , the energy must partly stay as heat , and can not be completely recovered as usable energy , except at the price of an increase in some other kind of heat-like increase in disorder in quantum states , in the universe ( such as an expansion of matter , or a randomisation in a crystal ) .
incandescent light bulbs consist of an air-tight glass enclosure ( the envelope , or bulb ) with a filament of tungsten wire inside the bulb , through which an electric current is passed . contact wires and a base with two ( or more ) conductors provide electrical connections to the filament . incandescent light bulbs usually contain a stem or glass mount anchored to the bulb 's base that allows the electrical contacts to run through the envelope without air or gas leaks . small wires embedded in the stem in turn support the filament and its lead wires .
the greek islands are traditionally grouped into the following clusters : the argo-saronic islands in the saronic gulf near athens , the cyclades , a large but dense collection occupying the central part of the aegean sea , the north aegean islands , a loose grouping off the west coast of turkey , the dodecanese , another loose collection in the southeast between crete and turkey , the sporades , a small tight group off the coast of northeast euboea , and the ionian islands , located to the west of the mainland in the ionian sea .
notable alumni include : alan mulally ( bs/ms ) , former president and ceo of ford motor company , lou montulli , co-founder of netscape and author of the lynx web browser , brian mcclendon ( bsee 1986 ) , vp of engineering at google , charles e. spahr ( 1934 ) , former ceo of standard oil of ohio .
in 1970 , the new haven black panther trials took place , the largest and longest trials in connecticut history . black panther party co-founder bobby seale and ten other party members were tried for murdering an alleged informant . beginning on may day , the city became a center of protest for 12,000 panther supporters , college students , and new left activists ( including jean genet , benjamin spock , abbie hoffman , jerry rubin , and john froines ) , who amassed on the new haven green , across the street from where the trials were being held . violent confrontations between the demonstrators and the new haven police occurred , and several bombs were set off in the area by radicals . the event became a rallying point for the new left and critics of the nixon administration .
canon law is the body of laws and regulations made by ecclesiastical authority ( church leadership ) , for the government of a christian organization or church and its members . it is the internal ecclesiastical law governing the catholic church ( both latin church and eastern catholic churches ) , the eastern and oriental orthodox churches , and the individual national churches within the anglican communion . the way that such church law is legislated , interpreted and at times adjudicated varies widely among these three bodies of churches . in all three traditions , a canon was originally a rule adopted by a church council ; these canons formed the foundation of canon law .
orthodox judaism holds that on mount sinai , the written law was transmitted along with an oral law . the words of the torah ( pentateuch ) were spoken to moses by god ; the laws contained in this written torah , the " mitzvot " , were given along with detailed explanations in the oral tradition as to how to apply and interpret them . furthermore , the oral law includes principles designed to create new rules . the oral law is held to be transmitted with an extremely high degree of accuracy . jewish theologians , who choose to emphasize the more evolutionary nature of the halacha point to a famous story in the talmud , where moses is miraculously transported to the house of study of rabbi akiva and is clearly unable to follow the ensuing discussion .
following thein sein 's first ever visit to the uk and a meeting with prime minister david cameron , the myanmar president declared that all of his nation 's political prisoners will be released by the end of 2013 , in addition to a statement of support for the well-being of the rohingya muslim community . in a speech at chatham house , he revealed that " we [ myanmar government ] are reviewing all cases . i guarantee to you that by the end of this year , there will be no prisoners of conscience in myanmar . " , in addition to expressing a desire to strengthen links between the uk and myanmar 's military forces .
copper has been used since ancient times as a durable , corrosion resistant , and weatherproof architectural material . roofs , flashings , rain gutters , downspouts , domes , spires , vaults , and doors have been made from copper for hundreds or thousands of years . copper 's architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding , building expansion joints , radio frequency shielding , and antimicrobial indoor products , such as attractive handrails , bathroom fixtures , and counter tops . some of copper 's other important benefits as an architectural material include its low thermal movement , light weight , lightning protection , and its recyclability .
he also introduced the notion of a 'universal machine ' ( now known as a universal turing machine ) , with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other machine , or in other words , it is provably capable of computing anything that is computable by executing a program stored on tape , allowing the machine to be programmable . von neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper . turing machines are to this day a central object of study in theory of computation . except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores , modern computers are said to be turing-complete , which is to say , they have algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal turing machine .
the u.s. , uk , france , italy and the majority of other western countries considered the annexation of estonia by the ussr illegal . they retained diplomatic relations with the representatives of the independent republic of estonia , never de jure recognised the existence of the estonian ssr , and never recognised estonia as a legal constituent part of the soviet union . estonia 's return to independence became possible as the soviet union faced internal regime challenges , loosening its hold on the outer empire . as the 1980s progressed , a movement for estonian autonomy started . in the initial period of 1987–1989 , this was partially for more economic independence , but as the soviet union weakened and it became increasingly obvious that nothing short of full independence would do , estonia began a course towards self-determination .
in styles that owe as much to videogame pixel art and popculture as to traditional mosaic , street art has seen a novel reinvention and expansion of mosaic artwork . the most prominent artist working with mosaics in street art is the french invader . he has done almost all his work in two very distinct mosaic styles , the first of which are small " traditional " tile mosaics of 8 bit video game character , installed in cities across the globe , and the second of which are a style he refers to as " rubikcubism " , which uses a kind of dual layer mosaic via grids of scrambled rubik 's cubes . although he is the most prominent , other street and urban artists do work in mosaic styles as well .
marine mammals are many , such as the dolphins , porpoises and whales , which are seen here during the migration period from december till may . turtles are a common sight along the coastline of the island . they are a protected species and in the endangered list . it is stated that it will take 15–50 years for this species to attain reproductive age . though they live in the sea , the females come to the shore to lay eggs and are protected by private societies . three species of turtles are particularly notable . these are : the leatherback sea turtles which have leather skin instead of a shell and are the largest of the type found here , some times measuring a much as 3 m ( average is about 1.5 m ) and weighing about 450 kg ( jellyfish is their favourite diet ) ; the hawksbill turtles , which have hawk-like beaks and found near reefs , generally about 90 cm in diameter and weigh about 60 kg and their diet consists of crabs and snails ; and the green turtles , herbivores which have rounded heads , generally about 90 cm in diameter and live amidst tall sea grasses .
this idea was later developed in ancient philosophy by the stoic school . stoic epistemology generally emphasized that the mind starts blank , but acquires knowledge as the outside world is impressed upon it . the doxographer aetius summarizes this view as " when a man is born , the stoics say , he has the commanding part of his soul like a sheet of paper ready for writing upon . " later stoics , such as sextus of chaeronea , would continue this idea of empiricism in later stoic writings as well . as sextus contends " for every thought comes from sense-perception or not without sense-perception and either from direct experience or not without direct experience " ( against the professors , 8.56-8 ) .
philadelphia has more public art than any other american city . in 1872 , the association for public art ( formerly the fairmount park art association ) was created , the first private association in the united states dedicated to integrating public art and urban planning . in 1959 , lobbying by the artists equity association helped create the percent for art ordinance , the first for a u.s. city . the program , which has funded more than 200 pieces of public art , is administered by the philadelphia office of arts and culture , the city 's art agency .
consequently , steam reforming typically employs an excess of h 2o . additional hydrogen can be recovered from the steam by use of carbon monoxide through the water gas shift reaction , especially with an iron oxide catalyst . this reaction is also a common industrial source of carbon dioxide :
several organizations concerned with antimicrobial resistance are lobbying to eliminate the unnecessary use of antibiotics . the issues of misuse and overuse of antibiotics have been addressed by the formation of the us interagency task force on antimicrobial resistance . this task force aims to actively address antimicrobial resistance , and is coordinated by the us centers for disease control and prevention , the food and drug administration ( fda ) , and the national institutes of health ( nih ) , as well as other us agencies . an ngo campaign group is keep antibiotics working . in france , an " antibiotics are not automatic " government campaign started in 2002 and led to a marked reduction of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions , especially in children .
when pasternak stopped producing durbin 's pictures , and she outgrew her screen persona and pursued more dramatic roles , the studio signed 13-year-old gloria jean for her own series of pasternak musicals from 1939 ; she went on to star with bing crosby , w. c. fields , and donald o'connor . a popular universal film of the late 1930s was destry rides again ( 1939 ) , starring james stewart as destry and marlene dietrich in her comeback role after leaving paramount studios .
by 1790 , the jewish population of alsace was approximately 22,500 , about 3 % of the provincial population . they were highly segregated and subject to long-standing anti-jewish regulations . they maintained their own customs , yiddish language , and historic traditions within the tightly-knit ghettos ; they adhered to talmudic law enforced by their rabbis . jews were barred from most cities and instead lived in villages . they concentrated in trade , services , and especially in money lending . they financed about a third of the mortgages in alsace . official tolerance grew during the french revolution , with full emancipation in 1791 . however , local antisemitism also increased and napoleon turned hostile in 1806 , imposing a one-year moratorium on all debts owed to jews . [ citation needed ] in the 1830-1870 era most jews moved to the cities , where they integrated and acculturated , as antisemitism sharply declined . by 1831 , the state began paying salaries to official rabbis , and in 1846 a special legal oath for jews was discontinued . antisemitic local riots occasionally occurred , especially during the revolution of 1848 . merger of alsace into germany in 1871-1918 lessened antisemitic violence .
major state highways include sr 94 , which connects downtown with i-805 , i-15 and east county ; sr 163 , which connects downtown with the northeast part of the city , intersects i-805 and merges with i-15 at miramar ; sr 52 , which connects la jolla with east county through santee and sr 125 ; sr 56 , which connects i-5 with i-15 through carmel valley and rancho peñasquitos ; sr 75 , which spans san diego bay as the san diego-coronado bridge , and also passes through south san diego as palm avenue ; and sr 905 , which connects i-5 and i-805 to the otay mesa port of entry .
biodiversity provides critical support for drug discovery and the availability of medicinal resources . a significant proportion of drugs are derived , directly or indirectly , from biological sources : at least 50 % of the pharmaceutical compounds on the us market are derived from plants , animals , and micro-organisms , while about 80 % of the world population depends on medicines from nature ( used in either modern or traditional medical practice ) for primary healthcare . only a tiny fraction of wild species has been investigated for medical potential . biodiversity has been critical to advances throughout the field of bionics . evidence from market analysis and biodiversity science indicates that the decline in output from the pharmaceutical sector since the mid-1980s can be attributed to a move away from natural product exploration ( " bioprospecting " ) in favor of genomics and synthetic chemistry , indeed claims about the value of undiscovered pharmaceuticals may not provide enough incentive for companies in free markets to search for them because of the high cost of development ; meanwhile , natural products have a long history of supporting significant economic and health innovation . marine ecosystems are particularly important , although inappropriate bioprospecting can increase biodiversity loss , as well as violating the laws of the communities and states from which the resources are taken .
predators may increase the biodiversity of communities by preventing a single species from becoming dominant . such predators are known as keystone species and may have a profound influence on the balance of organisms in a particular ecosystem . introduction or removal of this predator , or changes in its population density , can have drastic cascading effects on the equilibrium of many other populations in the ecosystem . for example , grazers of a grassland may prevent a single dominant species from taking over .
after being lit at the birthplace of the olympic games in olympia , greece on march 24 , the torch traveled to the panathinaiko stadium in athens , and then to beijing , arriving on march 31 . from beijing , the torch was following a route passing through six continents . the torch has visited cities along the silk road , symbolizing ancient links between china and the rest of the world . the relay also included an ascent with the flame to the top of mount everest on the border of nepal and tibet , china from the chinese side , which was closed specially for the event .
the end of adolescence and the beginning of adulthood varies by country and by function . furthermore , even within a single nation state or culture there can be different ages at which an individual is considered ( chronologically and legally ) mature enough for society to entrust them with certain privileges and responsibilities . such milestones include driving a vehicle , having legal sexual relations , serving in the armed forces or on a jury , purchasing and drinking alcohol , voting , entering into contracts , finishing certain levels of education , and marriage . adolescence is usually accompanied by an increased independence allowed by the parents or legal guardians , including less supervision as compared to preadolescence .
to create green sparks , fireworks use barium salts , such as barium chlorate , barium nitrate crystals , or barium chloride , also used for green fireplace logs . copper salts typically burn blue , but cupric chloride ( also known as " campfire blue " ) can also produce green flames . green pyrotechnic flares can use a mix ratio 75:25 of boron and potassium nitrate . smoke can be turned green by a mixture : solvent yellow 33 , solvent green 3 , lactose , magnesium carbonate plus sodium carbonate added to potassium chlorate .
bermuda 's national cricket team participated in the cricket world cup 2007 in the west indies . their most famous player is a 130 kilograms ( 290 lb ) police officer named dwayne leverock . but india defeated bermuda and set a record of 413 runs in a one-day international ( odi ) . bermuda were knocked out of the world cup . also very well-known is david hemp , a former captain of glamorgan in english first class cricket . the annual " cup match " cricket tournament between rival parishes st george 's in the east and somerset in the west is the occasion for a popular national holiday . this tournament began in 1872 when captain moresby of the royal navy introduced the game to bermuda , holding a match at somerset to mark forty years since the unjust thraldom of slavery . the east end versus west end rivalry resulted from the locations of the st. george 's garrison ( the original army headquarters in bermuda ) on barrack hill , st. george 's , and the royal naval dockyard at ireland island . moresby founded the somerset cricket club which plays the st. george 's cricket club in this game ( the membership of both clubs has long been mostly civilian ) .
however , leeches and their closest relatives have a body structure that is very uniform within the group but significantly different from that of other annelids , including other members of the clitellata . in leeches there are no septa , the connective tissue layer of the body wall is so thick that it occupies much of the body , and the two coelomata are widely separated and run the length of the body . they function as the main blood vessels , although they are side-by-side rather than upper and lower . however , they are lined with mesothelium , like the coelomata and unlike the blood vessels of other annelids . leeches generally use suckers at their front and rear ends to move like inchworms . the anus is on the upper surface of the pygidium .
the dynasty was founded by the jurchen aisin gioro clan in manchuria . in the late sixteenth century , nurhaci , originally a ming vassal , began organizing jurchen clans into " banners " , military-social units . nurhaci formed these clans into a unified entity , the subjects of which became known collectively as the manchu people . by 1636 , his son hong taiji began driving ming forces out of liaodong and declared a new dynasty , the qing . in 1644 , peasant rebels led by li zicheng conquered the ming capital beijing . rather than serve them , ming general wu sangui made an alliance with the manchus and opened the shanhai pass to the banner armies led by prince dorgon , who defeated the rebels and seized beijing . the conquest of china proper was not completed until 1683 under the kangxi emperor ( r. 1661–1722 ) . the ten great campaigns of the qianlong emperor from the 1750s to the 1790s extended qing control into central asia . while the early rulers maintained their manchu ways , and while their official title was emperor they were known as khans to the mongols and patronized tibetan buddhism , they governed using confucian styles and institutions of bureaucratic government . they retained the imperial examinations to recruit han chinese to work under or in parallel with manchus . they also adapted the ideals of the tributary system in international relations , and in places such as taiwan , the qing so-called internal foreign policy closely resembled colonial policy and control .
hydrogen production technologies been a significant area of solar chemical research since the 1970s . aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells , several thermochemical processes have also been explored . one such route uses concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures ( 2,300–2,600 °c or 4,200–4,700 °f ) . another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the steam reformation of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods . thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production . the solzinc process under development at the weizmann institute uses a 1 mw solar furnace to decompose zinc oxide ( zno ) at temperatures above 1,200 °c ( 2,200 °f ) . this initial reaction produces pure zinc , which can subsequently be reacted with water to produce hydrogen .
united nations ' secretary-general ban ki-moon has said that " renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity " . in october 2011 , he " announced the creation of a high-level group to drum up support for energy access , energy efficiency and greater use of renewable energy . the group is to be co-chaired by kandeh yumkella , the chair of un energy and director general of the un industrial development organisation , and charles holliday , chairman of bank of america " .
the town of stalybridge in cheshire is thought to have the pubs with both the longest and shortest names in the united kingdom — the old 13th cheshire rifleman corps inn and the q inn .
before creation of warsaw pact , fearing germany rearmed , czechoslovak leadership sought to create security pact with east germany and poland . these states protested strongly against re-militarization of west germany . the warsaw pact was primarily put in place as a consequence of the rearming of west germany inside nato . soviet leaders , as many european countries in both western and eastern side , feared germany being once again a military power as a direct threat and german militarism remained a fresh memory among soviets and eastern europeans . as soviet union had already bilateral treaties with all of its eastern satellites , the pact has been long considered 'superfluous ' , and because of the rushed way in which it was conceived , nato officials labeled it as a 'cardboard castle ' . previously , in march 1954 , the ussr , fearing the restoration of german militarism in west germany , requested admission to nato .
