a sample rate of 44.1 khz is almost always used , because this is also used for cd audio , the main source used for creating mp3 files . a greater variety of bit rates are used on the internet . the rate of 128 kbit/s is commonly used , at a compression ratio of 11:1 , offering adequate audio quality in a relatively small space . as internet bandwidth availability and hard drive sizes have increased , higher bit rates up to 320 kbit/s are widespread .
the epidermis is typically 10 to 30 cells thick ; its main function is to provide a waterproof layer . its outermost cells are constantly lost ; its bottommost cells are constantly dividing and pushing upward . the middle layer , the dermis , is 15 to 40 times thicker than the epidermis . the dermis is made up of many components , such as bony structures and blood vessels . the hypodermis is made up of adipose tissue . its job is to store lipids , and to provide cushioning and insulation . the thickness of this layer varies widely from species to species .
all protestant denominations reject the notion of papal supremacy over the church universal and generally deny the roman catholic doctrine of transubstantiation , but they disagree among themselves regarding the real presence of christ in the eucharist . the various denominations generally emphasize the priesthood of all believers , the doctrine of justification by faith alone ( sola fide ) rather than by or with good works , and a belief in the bible alone ( rather than with catholic tradition ) as the highest authority in matters of faith and morals ( sola scriptura ) . the " five solae " summarize the reformers ' basic differences in theological beliefs in opposition to the teaching of the roman catholic church of the day .

the railroads opened up the great plains for settlement , for now it was possible to ship wheat and other crops at low cost to the urban markets in the east , and europe . homestead land was free for american settlers . railroads sold their land at cheap rates to immigrants in expectation they would generate traffic as soon as farms were established . immigrants poured in , especially from germany and scandinavia . on the plains , very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch by themselves ; they clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife , and numerous children , to handle the many chores , including child-rearing , feeding and clothing the family , managing the housework , feeding the hired hands , and , especially after the 1930s , handling paperwork and financial details . during the early years of settlement , farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors . after approximately one generation , women increasingly left the fields , thus redefining their roles within the family . new technology including sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles . the scientific housekeeping movement , promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents , as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning , advice columns for women regarding farm bookkeeping , and home economics courses in the schools .
jesus ' death and resurrection underpin a variety of theological interpretations as to how salvation is granted to humanity . these interpretations vary widely in how much emphasis they place on the death of jesus as compared to his words . according to the substitutionary atonement view , jesus ' death is of central importance , and jesus willingly sacrificed himself as an act of perfect obedience as a sacrifice of love which pleased god . by contrast the moral influence theory of atonement focuses much more on the moral content of jesus ' teaching , and sees jesus ' death as a martyrdom . since the middle ages there has been conflict between these two views within western christianity . evangelical protestants typically hold a substitutionary view and in particular hold to the theory of penal substitution . liberal protestants typically reject substitutionary atonement and hold to the moral influence theory of atonement . both views are popular within the roman catholic church , with the satisfaction doctrine incorporated into the idea of penance .
the russian sfsr was controlled by the communist party of the soviet union , until the abortive 1991 august coup , which prompted president yeltsin to suspend the recently created communist party of the russian soviet federative socialist republic .
the gospel of matthew describes many women at the crucifixion , some of whom are named in the gospels . apart from these women , the three synoptic gospels speak of the presence of others : " the chief priests , with the scribes and elders " ; two robbers crucified , one on jesus ' right and one on his left , whom the gospel of luke presents as the penitent thief and the impenitent thief ; " the soldiers " , " the centurion and those who were with him , keeping watch over jesus " ; passers-by ; " bystanders " , " the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle " ; and " his acquaintances "
from the 9th century , the pecheneg nomads began an uneasy relationship with kievan rus′ . for over two centuries they launched sporadic raids into the lands of rus′ , which sometimes escalated into full-scale wars ( such as the 920 war on the pechenegs by igor of kiev reported in the primary chronicle ) , but there were also temporary military alliances ( e.g . the 943 byzantine campaign by igor ) . in 968 , the pechenegs attacked and besieged the city of kiev . some speculation exists that the pechenegs drove off the tivertsi and the ulichs to the regions of the upper dniester river in bukovina . the byzantine empire was known to support the pechenegs in their military campaigns against the eastern slavic states .

popper puzzled over the stark contrast between the non-scientific character of freud and adler 's theories in the field of psychology and the revolution set off by einstein 's theory of relativity in physics in the early 20th century . popper thought that einstein 's theory , as a theory properly grounded in scientific thought and method , was highly " risky " , in the sense that it was possible to deduce consequences from it which were , in the light of the then-dominant newtonian physics , highly improbable ( e.g. , that light is deflected towards solid bodies—confirmed by eddington 's experiments in 1919 ) , and which would , if they turned out to be false , falsify the whole theory . in contrast , nothing could , even in principle , falsify psychoanalytic theories . he thus came to the conclusion that psychoanalytic theories had more in common with primitive myths than with genuine science .
since whitehead 's metaphysics described a universe in which all entities experience , he needed a new way of describing perception that was not limited to living , self-conscious beings . the term he coined was " prehension " , which comes from the latin prehensio , meaning " to seize . " the term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious , applying to people as well as electrons . it is also intended to make clear whitehead 's rejection of the theory of representative perception , in which the mind only has private ideas about other entities . for whitehead , the term " prehension " indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself . in this way , entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations , rather than being independent of them . further , whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes , causal efficacy ( or " physical prehension " ) and presentational immediacy ( or " conceptual prehension " ) .
however , samoans greatly resented new zealand 's colonial rule , and blamed inflation and the catastrophic 1918 flu epidemic on its misrule . by the late 1920s the resistance movement against colonial rule had gathered widespread support . one of the mau leaders was olaf frederick nelson , a half samoan and half swedish merchant . nelson was eventually exiled during the late 1920s and early 1930s , but he continued to assist the organisation financially and politically . in accordance with the mau 's non-violent philosophy , the newly elected leader , high chief tupua tamasese lealofi , led his fellow uniformed mau in a peaceful demonstration in downtown apia on 28 december 1929 .
chemical communications in animals rely on a variety of aspects including taste and smell . chemoreception is the physiological response of a sense organ ( i.e . taste or smell ) to a chemical stimulus where the chemicals act as signals to regulate the state or activity of a cell . a semiochemical is a message-carrying chemical that is meant to attract , repel , and convey information . types of semiochemicals include pheromones and kairomones . one example is the butterfly phengaris arion which uses chemical signals as a form of mimicry to aid in predation .

the prussian army , under the terms of the armistice , held a brief victory parade in paris on 17 february ; the city was silent and draped with black and the germans quickly withdrew . bismarck honoured the armistice , by allowing train loads of food into paris and withdrawing prussian forces to the east of the city , prior to a full withdrawal once france agreed to pay a five billion franc war indemnity . at the same time , prussian forces were concentrated in the provinces of alsace and lorraine . an exodus occurred from paris as some 200,000 people , predominantly middle-class , went to the countryside .
canada has the world 's largest deposit of natural bitumen in the athabasca oil sands and canadian first nations along the athabasca river had long used it to waterproof their canoes . in 1719 , a cree indian named wa-pa-su brought a sample for trade to henry kelsey of the hudson ’ s bay company , who was the first recorded european to see it . however , it was n't until 1787 that fur trader and explorer alexander mackenzie saw the athabasca oil sands and said , " at about 24 miles from the fork ( of the athabasca and clearwater rivers ) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of 20 feet long may be inserted without the least resistance . "
the english word " translation " derives from the latin translatio ( which itself comes from trans- and from fero , the supine form of which is latum—together meaning " a carrying across " or " a bringing across " ) . the modern romance languages use equivalents of the english term " translation " that are derived from that same latin source or from the alternative latin traducere ( " to lead across " or " to bring across " ) . the slavic and germanic languages ( except in the case of the dutch equivalent , " vertaling " —a " re-language-ing " ) likewise use calques of these latin sources .
universities created by bilateral or multilateral treaties between states are intergovernmental . an example is the academy of european law , which offers training in european law to lawyers , judges , barristers , solicitors , in-house counsel and academics . euclid ( pôle universitaire euclide , euclid university ) is chartered as a university and umbrella organisation dedicated to sustainable development in signatory countries , and the united nations university engages in efforts to resolve the pressing global problems that are of concern to the united nations , its peoples and member states . the european university institute , a post-graduate university specialised in the social sciences , is officially an intergovernmental organisation , set up by the member states of the european union .
the higher-level phylogeny of the arthropods continues to be a matter of debate and research . in 2008 , researchers at tufts university uncovered what they believe is the world 's oldest known full-body impression of a primitive flying insect , a 300 million-year-old specimen from the carboniferous period . the oldest definitive insect fossil is the devonian rhyniognatha hirsti , from the 396-million-year-old rhynie chert . it may have superficially resembled a modern-day silverfish insect . this species already possessed dicondylic mandibles ( two articulations in the mandible ) , a feature associated with winged insects , suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time . thus , the first insects probably appeared earlier , in the silurian period .
the power of parliament to pass bills was often thwarted by monarchs . charles i dissolved parliament in 1629 , after it passed motions critical of and bills seeking to restrict his arbitrary exercise of power . during the eleven years of personal rule that followed , charles performed legally dubious actions , such as raising taxes without parliament 's approval . after the english civil war , it was accepted that parliament should be summoned to meet regularly , but it was still commonplace for monarchs to refuse royal assent to bills . in 1678 , charles ii withheld his assent from a bill " for preserving the peace of the kingdom by raising the militia , and continuing them in duty for two and forty days , " suggesting that he , not parliament , should control the militia . the last stuart monarch , anne , similarly withheld on 11 march 1708 , on the advice of her ministers , her assent from a bill for the settling of militia in scotland . no monarch has since withheld royal assent on a bill passed by the british parliament .
height limits in the melbourne cbd were lifted in 1958 , after the construction of ici house , transforming the city 's skyline with the introduction of skyscrapers . suburban expansion then intensified , serviced by new indoor malls beginning with chadstone shopping centre . the post-war period also saw a major renewal of the cbd and st kilda road which significantly modernised the city . new fire regulations and redevelopment saw most of the taller pre-war cbd buildings either demolished or partially retained through a policy of facadism . many of the larger suburban mansions from the boom era were also either demolished or subdivided .
players may only be transferred during transfer windows that are set by the football association . the two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 august and from 31 december to 31 january . player registrations can not be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the fa , usually on an emergency basis . as of the 2010–11 season , the premier league introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21 , with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances . this was to enable the 'home grown ' rule to be enacted , whereby the league would also from 2010 require at least 8 of the named 25 man squad to be made up of 'home-grown players ' .
several political figures who served as zhejiang 's top political office of communist party secretary have played key roles in various events in prc history . tan zhenlin ( term 1949-1952 ) , the inaugural party secretary , was one of the leading voices against mao 's cultural revolution during the so-called february countercurrent of 1967 . jiang hua ( term 1956-1968 ) , was the " chief justice " on the special court in the case against the gang of four in 1980 . three provincial party secretaries since the 1990s have gone onto prominence at the national level . they include cpc general secretary and president xi jinping ( term 2002-2007 ) , national people 's congress chairman and former vice-premier zhang dejiang ( term 1998-2002 ) , and zhao hongzhu ( term 2007-2012 ) , the deputy secretary of the central commission for discipline inspection , china 's top anti-corruption body . of zhejiang 's fourteen party secretaries since 1949 , none were native to the province .
the massive work was arranged according to a " tree of knowledge . " the tree reflected the marked division between the arts and sciences , which was largely a result of the rise of empiricism . both areas of knowledge were united by philosophy , or the trunk of the tree of knowledge . the enlightenment 's desacrilization of religion was pronounced in the tree 's design , particularly where theology accounted for a peripheral branch , with black magic as a close neighbour . as the encyclopédie gained popularity , it was published in quarto and octavo editions after 1777 . the quarto and octavo editions were much less expensive than previous editions , making the encyclopédie more accessible to the non-elite . robert darnton estimates that there were approximately 25 000 copies of the encyclopédie in circulation throughout france and europe before the french revolution . the extensive , yet affordable encyclopedia came to represent the transmission of enlightenment and scientific education to an expanding audience .
by the middle ages , large numbers of jews lived in the holy roman empire and had assimilated into german culture , including many jews who had previously assimilated into french culture and had spoken a mixed judeo-french language . upon assimilating into german culture , the jewish german peoples incorporated major parts of the german language and elements of other european languages into a mixed language known as yiddish . however tolerance and assimilation of jews in german society suddenly ended during the crusades with many jews being forcefully expelled from germany and western yiddish disappeared as a language in germany over the centuries , with german jewish people fully adopting the german language .
the required beliefs of these clauses include belief in a supreme being and belief in a future state of rewards and punishments . ( tennessee constitution article ix , section 2 is one such example . ) some of these same states specify that the oath of office include the words " so help me god . " in some cases these beliefs ( or oaths ) were historically required of jurors and witnesses in court . at one time , such restrictions were allowed under the doctrine of states ' rights ; today they are deemed to be in violation of the federal first amendment , as applied to the states via the 14th amendment , and hence unconstitutional and unenforceable .
during the napoleonic occupation of spain , miguel hidalgo y costilla , a catholic priest of progressive ideas , declared mexican independence in the small town of dolores , guanajuato on september 16 , 1810 with a proclamation known as the " grito de dolores " . hidalgo built a large support among intellectuals , liberal priests and many poor people . hidalgo fought to protect the rights of the poor and indigenous population . he started on a march to the capital , mexico city , but retreated back north when faced with the elite of the royal forces at the outskirts of the capital . he established a liberal government from guadalajara , jalisco but was soon forced to flee north by the royal forces that recaptured the city . hidalgo attempted to reach the united states and gain american support for mexican independence . hidalgo reached saltillo , coahuila where he publicly resigned his military post and rejected a pardon offered by viceroy francisco venegas in return for hidalgo 's surrender . a short time later , he and his supporters were captured by royalist ignacio elizondo at the wells of baján ( norias de baján ) on march 21 , 1811 and taken to the city of chihuahua . hidalgo forced the bishop of valladolid , manuel abad y queipo , to rescind the excommunication order he had circulated against him on september 24 , 1810 . later , the inquisition issued an excommunication edict on october 13 , 1810 condemning miguel hidalgo as a seditionary , apostate , and heretic .
most electrification systems use overhead wires , but third rail is an option up to about 1,200 v. third rail systems exclusively use dc distribution . the use of ac is not feasible because the dimensions of a third rail are physically very large compared with the skin depth that the alternating current penetrates to ( 0.3 millimetres or 0.012 inches ) in a steel rail ) . this effect makes the resistance per unit length unacceptably high compared with the use of dc . third rail is more compact than overhead wires and can be used in smaller-diameter tunnels , an important factor for subway systems .
in january 2002 , the u.s. sent more than 1,200 troops ( later raised to 2,000 ) to assist the armed forces of the philippines in combating terrorist groups linked to al-qaida , such as abu sayyaf , under operation enduring freedom - philippines . operations have taken place mostly in the sulu archipelago , where terrorists and other groups are active . the majority of troops provide logistics . however , there are special forces troops that are training and assisting in combat operations against the terrorist groups .

the conversion rate of omega-6 dgla to aa largely determines the production of the prostaglandins pge1 and pge2 . omega-3 epa prevents aa from being released from membranes , thereby skewing prostaglandin balance away from pro-inflammatory pge2 ( made from aa ) toward anti-inflammatory pge1 ( made from dgla ) . moreover , the conversion ( desaturation ) of dgla to aa is controlled by the enzyme delta-5-desaturase , which in turn is controlled by hormones such as insulin ( up-regulation ) and glucagon ( down-regulation ) . the amount and type of carbohydrates consumed , along with some types of amino acid , can influence processes involving insulin , glucagon , and other hormones ; therefore , the ratio of omega-3 versus omega-6 has wide effects on general health , and specific effects on immune function and inflammation , and mitosis ( i.e. , cell division ) .
since 2001 , miami has been undergoing a large building boom with more than 50 skyscrapers rising over 400 feet ( 122 m ) built or currently under construction in the city . miami 's skyline is ranked third-most impressive in the u.s. , behind new york city and chicago , and 19th in the world according to the almanac of architecture and design . the city currently has the eight tallest ( as well as thirteen of the fourteen tallest ) skyscrapers in the state of florida , with the tallest being the 789-foot ( 240 m ) four seasons hotel & tower .
beginning with immanuel kant , german idealists such as g. w. f. hegel , johann gottlieb fichte , friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling , and arthur schopenhauer dominated 19th-century philosophy . this tradition , which emphasized the mental or " ideal " character of all phenomena , gave birth to idealistic and subjectivist schools ranging from british idealism to phenomenalism to existentialism . the historical influence of this branch of idealism remains central even to the schools that rejected its metaphysical assumptions , such as marxism , pragmatism and positivism .
the rose garden ( rosengarten ) , from which a scenic panoramic view of the medieval town centre can be enjoyed , is a well-kept rosarium on a hill , converted into a park from a former cemetery in 1913 .
philadelphia gas works ( pgw ) , overseen by the pennsylvania public utility commission , is the nation 's largest municipally owned natural gas utility . it serves over 500,000 homes and businesses in the philadelphia area . founded in 1836 , the company came under city ownership in 1987 and has been providing the majority of gas distributed within city limits . in 2014 , the philadelphia city council refused to conduct hearings on a $ 1.86 billion sale of pgw , part of a two-year effort that was proposed by the mayor . the refusal led to the prospective buyer terminating its offer .
when it turned out that there would not be enough uranium-235 to make more than one bomb , the implosive lens project was greatly expanded and von neumann 's idea was implemented . implosion was the only method that could be used with the plutonium-239 that was available from the hanford site . he established the design of the explosive lenses required , but there remained concerns about " edge effects " and imperfections in the explosives . his calculations showed that implosion would work if it did not depart by more than 5 % from spherical symmetry . after a series of failed attempts with models , this was achieved by george kistiakowsky , and the construction of the trinity bomb was completed in july 1945 .
as the kulluk oil rig was being towed to the american state of washington to be serviced in preparation for the 2013 drilling season , a winter storm on 27 december 2012 caused the towing crews , as well as the rescue service , to lose control of the situation . as of 1 january 2013 , the kulluk was grounded off the coast sitkalidak island , near the eastern end of kodiak island . following the accident , a fortune magazine contacted larry mckinney , the executive director at the harte research institute for gulf of mexico studies at texas a & m , and he explained that " a two-month delay in the arctic is not a two-month delay ... a two-month delay could wipe out the entire drilling season . "
proteins are structural materials in much of the animal body ( e.g . muscles , skin , and hair ) . they also form the enzymes that control chemical reactions throughout the body . each protein molecule is composed of amino acids , which are characterized by inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulphur ( these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein , such as the keratin in hair ) . the body requires amino acids to produce new proteins ( protein retention ) and to replace damaged proteins ( maintenance ) . as there is no protein or amino acid storage provision , amino acids must be present in the diet . excess amino acids are discarded , typically in the urine . for all animals , some amino acids are essential ( an animal can not produce them internally ) and some are non-essential ( the animal can produce them from other nitrogen-containing compounds ) . about twenty amino acids are found in the human body , and about ten of these are essential and , therefore , must be included in the diet . a diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids ( especially those that are essential ) is particularly important in some situations : during early development and maturation , pregnancy , lactation , or injury ( a burn , for instance ) . a complete protein source contains all the essential amino acids ; an incomplete protein source lacks one or more of the essential amino acids .
milena sterio , american expert of international law , includes the former axis powers ( germany , italy and japan ) and india among the great powers along with the permanent members of the unsc . she considers germany , japan and italy to be great powers due to their g7 membership and because of their influence in regional and international organizations . various authors describe italy as an equal major power , while others view italy as an " intermittent great power " or as " the least of the great powers " .
westminster school and westminster abbey choir school are also in the precincts of the abbey . it was natural for the learned and literate monks to be entrusted with education , and benedictine monks were required by the pope to maintain a charity school in 1179 . the choir school educates and trains the choirboys who sing for services in the abbey .
the cubs enjoyed one more pennant at the close of world war ii , finishing 98–56 . due to the wartime travel restrictions , the first three games of the 1945 world series were played in detroit , where the cubs won two games , including a one-hitter by claude passeau , and the final four were played at wrigley . in game 4 of the series , the curse of the billy goat was allegedly laid upon the cubs when p.k . wrigley ejected billy sianis , who had come to game 4 with two box seat tickets , one for him and one for his goat . they paraded around for a few innings , but wrigley demanded the goat leave the park due to its unpleasant odor . upon his ejection , mr. sianis uttered , " the cubs , they ai n't gon na win no more . " the cubs lost game 4 , lost the series , and have not been back since . it has also been said by many that sianis put a " curse " on the cubs , apparently preventing the team from playing in the world series . after losing the 1945 world series to the detroit tigers , the cubs finished with winning seasons the next two years , but those teams did not enter post-season play .
epigenetic changes in eukaryotic biology serve to regulate the process of cellular differentiation . during morphogenesis , totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo , which in turn become fully differentiated cells . a single fertilized egg cell , the zygote , gives rise to the many different plant cell types including parenchyma , xylem vessel elements , phloem sieve tubes , guard cells of the epidermis , etc . as it continues to divide . the process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others .
television has played a major role in the history of the premier league . the league 's decision to assign broadcasting rights to bskyb in 1992 was at the time a radical decision , but one that has paid off . at the time pay television was an almost untested proposition in the uk market , as was charging fans to watch live televised football . however , a combination of sky 's strategy , the quality of premier league football and the public 's appetite for the game has seen the value of the premier league 's tv rights soar .

protestantism is a form of christian faith and practice which originated with the protestant reformation , [ a ] a movement against what its followers considered to be errors in the roman catholic church . it is one of the three major divisions of christendom , together with roman catholicism and eastern orthodoxy . anglicanism is sometimes considered to be independent from protestantism . [ b ] the term derives from the letter of protestation from lutheran princes in 1529 against an edict condemning the teachings of martin luther as heretical .
queen 's last album featuring mercury , titled made in heaven , was finally released in 1995 , four years after his death . featuring tracks such as " too much love will kill you " and " heaven for everyone " , it was constructed from mercury 's final recordings in 1991 , material left over from their previous studio albums and re-worked material from may , taylor , and mercury 's solo albums . the album also featured the song " mother love " , the last vocal recording mercury made prior to his death , which he completed using a drum machine , over which may , taylor and deacon later added the instrumental track . after completing the penultimate verse , mercury had told the band he " was n't feeling that great " and stated , " i will finish it when i come back , next time " ; however , he never made it back into the studio , so may later recorded the final verse of the song . both stages of recording , before and after mercury 's death , were completed at the band 's studio in montreux , switzerland . the album reached no . 1 on the uk charts immediately following its release , and has sold 20 million copies worldwide . on 25 november 1996 , a statue of mercury was unveiled in montreux overlooking lake geneva , almost five years to the day since his death .
congress has the sole power to legislate for the united states . under the nondelegation doctrine , congress may not delegate its lawmaking responsibilities to any other agency . in this vein , the supreme court held in the 1998 case clinton v. city of new york that congress could not delegate a " line-item veto " to the president , by powers vested in the government by the constitution .
the resulting treaty of schönbrunn in october 1809 was the harshest that france had imposed on austria in recent memory . metternich and archduke charles had the preservation of the habsburg empire as their fundamental goal , and to this end they succeeded by making napoleon seek more modest goals in return for promises of friendship between the two powers . nevertheless , while most of the hereditary lands remained a part of the habsburg realm , france received carinthia , carniola , and the adriatic ports , while galicia was given to the poles and the salzburg area of the tyrol went to the bavarians . austria lost over three million subjects , about one-fifth of her total population , as a result of these territorial changes . although fighting in iberia continued , the war of the fifth coalition would be the last major conflict on the european continent for the next three years .
usb data is transmitted by toggling the data lines between the j state and the opposite k state . usb encodes data using the nrzi line coding ; a 0 bit is transmitted by toggling the data lines from j to k or vice versa , while a 1 bit is transmitted by leaving the data lines as-is . to ensure a minimum density of signal transitions remains in the bitstream , usb uses bit stuffing ; an extra 0 bit is inserted into the data stream after any appearance of six consecutive 1 bits . seven consecutive received 1 bits is always an error . usb 3.0 has introduced additional data transmission encodings .
section 6 of the endangered species act provided funding for development of programs for management of threatened and endangered species by state wildlife agencies . subsequently , lists of endangered and threatened species within their boundaries have been prepared by each state . these state lists often include species which are considered endangered or threatened within a specific state but not within all states , and which therefore are not included on the national list of endangered and threatened species . examples include florida , minnesota , maine , and california .
the band have released a total of eighteen number one albums , eighteen number one singles , and ten number one dvds worldwide , making them one of the world 's best-selling music artists . queen have sold over 150 million records , with some estimates in excess of 300 million records worldwide , including 34.5 million albums in the us as of 2004 . inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in 2001 , the band is the only group in which every member has composed more than one chart-topping single , and all four members were inducted into the songwriters hall of fame in 2003 . in 2009 , " we will rock you " and " we are the champions " were inducted into the grammy hall of fame , and the latter was voted the world 's favourite song in a global music poll .
the criminal justice information services ( cjis ) division , is located in clarksburg , west virginia . organized beginning in 1991 , the office opened in 1995 as the youngest agency division . the complex is the length of three football fields . it provides a main repository for information in various data systems . under the roof of the cjis are the programs for the national crime information center ( ncic ) , uniform crime reporting ( ucr ) , fingerprint identification , integrated automated fingerprint identification system ( iafis ) , ncic 2000 , and the national incident-based reporting system ( nibrs ) . many state and local agencies use these data systems as a source for their own investigations and contribute to the database using secure communications . fbi provides these tools of sophisticated identification and information services to local , state , federal , and international law enforcement agencies .
the u.s. digital millennium copyright act ( 1998 ) and the european e-commerce directive ( 2000 ) provide online intermediaries with limited statutory immunity from liability for copyright infringement . online intermediaries hosting content that infringes copyright are not liable , so long as they do not know about it and take actions once the infringing content is brought to their attention . in u.s. law this is characterized as " safe harbor " provisions . under european law , the governing principles for internet service providers are " mere conduit " , meaning that they are neutral 'pipes ' with no knowledge of what they are carrying ; and 'no obligation to monitor ' meaning that they can not be given a general mandate by governments to monitor content . these two principles are a barrier for certain forms of online copyright enforcement and they were the reason behind an attempt to amend the european telecoms package in 2009 to support new measures against copyright infringement .
in 1948 , the point-contact transistor was independently invented by german physicists herbert mataré and heinrich welker while working at the compagnie des freins et signaux , a westinghouse subsidiary located in paris . mataré had previous experience in developing crystal rectifiers from silicon and germanium in the german radar effort during world war ii . using this knowledge , he began researching the phenomenon of " interference " in 1947 . by june 1948 , witnessing currents flowing through point-contacts , mataré produced consistent results using samples of germanium produced by welker , similar to what bardeen and brattain had accomplished earlier in december 1947 . realizing that bell labs ' scientists had already invented the transistor before them , the company rushed to get its " transistron " into production for amplified use in france 's telephone network .
in 1984 , he was appointed a member of the order of the companions of honour by queen elizabeth ii on the advice of prime minister margaret thatcher for his " services to the study of economics " . he was the first recipient of the hanns martin schleyer prize in 1984 . he also received the us presidential medal of freedom in 1991 from president george h. w. bush . in 2011 , his article " the use of knowledge in society " was selected as one of the top 20 articles published in the american economic review during its first 100 years .
cultural practices in the americas seem to have been shared mostly within geographical zones where unrelated peoples adopted similar technologies and social organizations . an example of such a cultural area is mesoamerica , where millennia of coexistence and shared development among the peoples of the region produced a fairly homogeneous culture with complex agricultural and social patterns . another well-known example is the north american plains where until the 19th century several peoples shared the traits of nomadic hunter-gatherers based primarily on buffalo hunting .
treaties formed an important part of european colonization and , in many parts of the world , europeans attempted to legitimize their sovereignty by signing treaties with indigenous peoples . in most cases these treaties were in extremely disadvantageous terms to the native people , who often did not appreciate the implications of what they were signing .
in 1903 , josiah white iii bought a parcel of land near ohio avenue and the boardwalk and built the queen anne style marlborough house . the hotel was a hit and , in 1905–06 , he chose to expand the hotel and bought another parcel of land next door to his marlborough house . in an effort to make his new hotel a source of conversation , white hired the architectural firm of price and mclanahan . the firm made use of reinforced concrete , a new building material invented by jean-louis lambot in 1848 ( joseph monier received the patent in 1867 ) . the hotel 's spanish and moorish themes , capped off with its signature dome and chimneys , represented a step forward from other hotels that had a classically designed influence . white named the new hotel the blenheim and merged the two hotels into the marlborough-blenheim . bally 's atlantic city was later constructed at this location .
san diego is one of the top-ten best climates in the farmers ' almanac and is one of the two best summer climates in america as scored by the weather channel . under the köppen–geiger climate classification system , the san diego area has been variously categorized as having either a semi-arid climate ( bsh in the original classification and bskn in modified köppen classification ) or a mediterranean climate ( csa and csb ) . san diego 's climate is characterized by warm , dry summers and mild winters with most of the annual precipitation falling between december and march . the city has a mild climate year-round , with an average of 201 days above 70 °f ( 21 °c ) and low rainfall ( 9–13 inches [ 230–330 mm ] annually ) . dewpoints in the summer months range from 57.0 °f ( 13.9 °c ) to 62.4 °f ( 16.9 °c ) .
on march 10 , 1876 , three days after his patent was issued , bell succeeded in getting his telephone to work , using a liquid transmitter similar to gray 's design . vibration of the diaphragm caused a needle to vibrate in the water , varying the electrical resistance in the circuit . when bell spoke the famous sentence " mr. watson—come here—i want to see you " into the liquid transmitter , watson , listening at the receiving end in an adjoining room , heard the words clearly .
tajikistan ( i/tɑːˈdʒiːkᵻstɑːn/ , /təˈdʒiːkᵻstæn/ , or /tæˈdʒiːkiːstæn/ ; persian : تاجيكستان‎‎ тоҷикистон [ tɔd͡ʒikɪsˈtɔn ] ) , officially the republic of tajikistan ( persian : جمهورى تاجيكستان‎‎ tajik : ҷумҳурии тоҷикистон , çumhuriji toçikiston/jumhuriyi tojikiston ; russian : респу́блика таджикистан , respublika tadzhikistan ) , is a mountainous , landlocked country in central asia with an estimated 8 million people in 2013 , and an area of 143,100 km2 ( 55,300 sq mi ) . it is bordered by afghanistan to the south , uzbekistan to the west , kyrgyzstan to the north , and china to the east . pakistan lies to the south , separated by the narrow wakhan corridor . traditional homelands of tajik people included present-day tajikistan , afghanistan and uzbekistan .
in 2000 , the fbi began the trilogy project to upgrade its outdated information technology ( it ) infrastructure . this project , originally scheduled to take three years and cost around $ 380 million , ended up going far over budget and behind schedule . efforts to deploy modern computers and networking equipment were generally successful , but attempts to develop new investigation software , outsourced to science applications international corporation ( saic ) , were not . virtual case file , or vcf , as the software was known , was plagued by poorly defined goals , and repeated changes in management . in january 2005 , more than two years after the software was originally planned for completion , the fbi officially abandoned the project . at least $ 100 million ( and much more by some estimates ) was spent on the project , which never became operational . the fbi has been forced to continue using its decade-old automated case support system , which it experts consider woefully inadequate . in march 2005 , the fbi announced it was beginning a new , more ambitious software project , code-named sentinel , which they expected to complete by 2009 .
thermodynamics divides energy transformation into two kinds : reversible processes and irreversible processes . an irreversible process is one in which energy is dissipated ( spread ) into empty energy states available in a volume , from which it can not be recovered into more concentrated forms ( fewer quantum states ) , without degradation of even more energy . a reversible process is one in which this sort of dissipation does not happen . for example , conversion of energy from one type of potential field to another , is reversible , as in the pendulum system described above . in processes where heat is generated , quantum states of lower energy , present as possible excitations in fields between atoms , act as a reservoir for part of the energy , from which it can not be recovered , in order to be converted with 100 % efficiency into other forms of energy . in this case , the energy must partly stay as heat , and can not be completely recovered as usable energy , except at the price of an increase in some other kind of heat-like increase in disorder in quantum states , in the universe ( such as an expansion of matter , or a randomisation in a crystal ) .
incandescent light bulbs consist of an air-tight glass enclosure ( the envelope , or bulb ) with a filament of tungsten wire inside the bulb , through which an electric current is passed . contact wires and a base with two ( or more ) conductors provide electrical connections to the filament . incandescent light bulbs usually contain a stem or glass mount anchored to the bulb 's base that allows the electrical contacts to run through the envelope without air or gas leaks . small wires embedded in the stem in turn support the filament and its lead wires .
the greek islands are traditionally grouped into the following clusters : the argo-saronic islands in the saronic gulf near athens , the cyclades , a large but dense collection occupying the central part of the aegean sea , the north aegean islands , a loose grouping off the west coast of turkey , the dodecanese , another loose collection in the southeast between crete and turkey , the sporades , a small tight group off the coast of northeast euboea , and the ionian islands , located to the west of the mainland in the ionian sea .
notable alumni include : alan mulally ( bs/ms ) , former president and ceo of ford motor company , lou montulli , co-founder of netscape and author of the lynx web browser , brian mcclendon ( bsee 1986 ) , vp of engineering at google , charles e. spahr ( 1934 ) , former ceo of standard oil of ohio .
in 1970 , the new haven black panther trials took place , the largest and longest trials in connecticut history . black panther party co-founder bobby seale and ten other party members were tried for murdering an alleged informant . beginning on may day , the city became a center of protest for 12,000 panther supporters , college students , and new left activists ( including jean genet , benjamin spock , abbie hoffman , jerry rubin , and john froines ) , who amassed on the new haven green , across the street from where the trials were being held . violent confrontations between the demonstrators and the new haven police occurred , and several bombs were set off in the area by radicals . the event became a rallying point for the new left and critics of the nixon administration .
canon law is the body of laws and regulations made by ecclesiastical authority ( church leadership ) , for the government of a christian organization or church and its members . it is the internal ecclesiastical law governing the catholic church ( both latin church and eastern catholic churches ) , the eastern and oriental orthodox churches , and the individual national churches within the anglican communion . the way that such church law is legislated , interpreted and at times adjudicated varies widely among these three bodies of churches . in all three traditions , a canon was originally a rule adopted by a church council ; these canons formed the foundation of canon law .
orthodox judaism holds that on mount sinai , the written law was transmitted along with an oral law . the words of the torah ( pentateuch ) were spoken to moses by god ; the laws contained in this written torah , the " mitzvot " , were given along with detailed explanations in the oral tradition as to how to apply and interpret them . furthermore , the oral law includes principles designed to create new rules . the oral law is held to be transmitted with an extremely high degree of accuracy . jewish theologians , who choose to emphasize the more evolutionary nature of the halacha point to a famous story in the talmud , where moses is miraculously transported to the house of study of rabbi akiva and is clearly unable to follow the ensuing discussion .
following thein sein 's first ever visit to the uk and a meeting with prime minister david cameron , the myanmar president declared that all of his nation 's political prisoners will be released by the end of 2013 , in addition to a statement of support for the well-being of the rohingya muslim community . in a speech at chatham house , he revealed that " we [ myanmar government ] are reviewing all cases . i guarantee to you that by the end of this year , there will be no prisoners of conscience in myanmar . " , in addition to expressing a desire to strengthen links between the uk and myanmar 's military forces .
copper has been used since ancient times as a durable , corrosion resistant , and weatherproof architectural material . roofs , flashings , rain gutters , downspouts , domes , spires , vaults , and doors have been made from copper for hundreds or thousands of years . copper 's architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding , building expansion joints , radio frequency shielding , and antimicrobial indoor products , such as attractive handrails , bathroom fixtures , and counter tops . some of copper 's other important benefits as an architectural material include its low thermal movement , light weight , lightning protection , and its recyclability .
he also introduced the notion of a 'universal machine ' ( now known as a universal turing machine ) , with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other machine , or in other words , it is provably capable of computing anything that is computable by executing a program stored on tape , allowing the machine to be programmable . von neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper . turing machines are to this day a central object of study in theory of computation . except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores , modern computers are said to be turing-complete , which is to say , they have algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal turing machine .
the u.s. , uk , france , italy and the majority of other western countries considered the annexation of estonia by the ussr illegal . they retained diplomatic relations with the representatives of the independent republic of estonia , never de jure recognised the existence of the estonian ssr , and never recognised estonia as a legal constituent part of the soviet union . estonia 's return to independence became possible as the soviet union faced internal regime challenges , loosening its hold on the outer empire . as the 1980s progressed , a movement for estonian autonomy started . in the initial period of 1987–1989 , this was partially for more economic independence , but as the soviet union weakened and it became increasingly obvious that nothing short of full independence would do , estonia began a course towards self-determination .
in styles that owe as much to videogame pixel art and popculture as to traditional mosaic , street art has seen a novel reinvention and expansion of mosaic artwork . the most prominent artist working with mosaics in street art is the french invader . he has done almost all his work in two very distinct mosaic styles , the first of which are small " traditional " tile mosaics of 8 bit video game character , installed in cities across the globe , and the second of which are a style he refers to as " rubikcubism " , which uses a kind of dual layer mosaic via grids of scrambled rubik 's cubes . although he is the most prominent , other street and urban artists do work in mosaic styles as well .
marine mammals are many , such as the dolphins , porpoises and whales , which are seen here during the migration period from december till may . turtles are a common sight along the coastline of the island . they are a protected species and in the endangered list . it is stated that it will take 15–50 years for this species to attain reproductive age . though they live in the sea , the females come to the shore to lay eggs and are protected by private societies . three species of turtles are particularly notable . these are : the leatherback sea turtles which have leather skin instead of a shell and are the largest of the type found here , some times measuring a much as 3 m ( average is about 1.5 m ) and weighing about 450 kg ( jellyfish is their favourite diet ) ; the hawksbill turtles , which have hawk-like beaks and found near reefs , generally about 90 cm in diameter and weigh about 60 kg and their diet consists of crabs and snails ; and the green turtles , herbivores which have rounded heads , generally about 90 cm in diameter and live amidst tall sea grasses .
this idea was later developed in ancient philosophy by the stoic school . stoic epistemology generally emphasized that the mind starts blank , but acquires knowledge as the outside world is impressed upon it . the doxographer aetius summarizes this view as " when a man is born , the stoics say , he has the commanding part of his soul like a sheet of paper ready for writing upon . " later stoics , such as sextus of chaeronea , would continue this idea of empiricism in later stoic writings as well . as sextus contends " for every thought comes from sense-perception or not without sense-perception and either from direct experience or not without direct experience " ( against the professors , 8.56-8 ) .
philadelphia has more public art than any other american city . in 1872 , the association for public art ( formerly the fairmount park art association ) was created , the first private association in the united states dedicated to integrating public art and urban planning . in 1959 , lobbying by the artists equity association helped create the percent for art ordinance , the first for a u.s. city . the program , which has funded more than 200 pieces of public art , is administered by the philadelphia office of arts and culture , the city 's art agency .
consequently , steam reforming typically employs an excess of h 2o . additional hydrogen can be recovered from the steam by use of carbon monoxide through the water gas shift reaction , especially with an iron oxide catalyst . this reaction is also a common industrial source of carbon dioxide :
several organizations concerned with antimicrobial resistance are lobbying to eliminate the unnecessary use of antibiotics . the issues of misuse and overuse of antibiotics have been addressed by the formation of the us interagency task force on antimicrobial resistance . this task force aims to actively address antimicrobial resistance , and is coordinated by the us centers for disease control and prevention , the food and drug administration ( fda ) , and the national institutes of health ( nih ) , as well as other us agencies . an ngo campaign group is keep antibiotics working . in france , an " antibiotics are not automatic " government campaign started in 2002 and led to a marked reduction of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions , especially in children .
when pasternak stopped producing durbin 's pictures , and she outgrew her screen persona and pursued more dramatic roles , the studio signed 13-year-old gloria jean for her own series of pasternak musicals from 1939 ; she went on to star with bing crosby , w. c. fields , and donald o'connor . a popular universal film of the late 1930s was destry rides again ( 1939 ) , starring james stewart as destry and marlene dietrich in her comeback role after leaving paramount studios .
by 1790 , the jewish population of alsace was approximately 22,500 , about 3 % of the provincial population . they were highly segregated and subject to long-standing anti-jewish regulations . they maintained their own customs , yiddish language , and historic traditions within the tightly-knit ghettos ; they adhered to talmudic law enforced by their rabbis . jews were barred from most cities and instead lived in villages . they concentrated in trade , services , and especially in money lending . they financed about a third of the mortgages in alsace . official tolerance grew during the french revolution , with full emancipation in 1791 . however , local antisemitism also increased and napoleon turned hostile in 1806 , imposing a one-year moratorium on all debts owed to jews . [ citation needed ] in the 1830-1870 era most jews moved to the cities , where they integrated and acculturated , as antisemitism sharply declined . by 1831 , the state began paying salaries to official rabbis , and in 1846 a special legal oath for jews was discontinued . antisemitic local riots occasionally occurred , especially during the revolution of 1848 . merger of alsace into germany in 1871-1918 lessened antisemitic violence .
major state highways include sr 94 , which connects downtown with i-805 , i-15 and east county ; sr 163 , which connects downtown with the northeast part of the city , intersects i-805 and merges with i-15 at miramar ; sr 52 , which connects la jolla with east county through santee and sr 125 ; sr 56 , which connects i-5 with i-15 through carmel valley and rancho peñasquitos ; sr 75 , which spans san diego bay as the san diego-coronado bridge , and also passes through south san diego as palm avenue ; and sr 905 , which connects i-5 and i-805 to the otay mesa port of entry .
biodiversity provides critical support for drug discovery and the availability of medicinal resources . a significant proportion of drugs are derived , directly or indirectly , from biological sources : at least 50 % of the pharmaceutical compounds on the us market are derived from plants , animals , and micro-organisms , while about 80 % of the world population depends on medicines from nature ( used in either modern or traditional medical practice ) for primary healthcare . only a tiny fraction of wild species has been investigated for medical potential . biodiversity has been critical to advances throughout the field of bionics . evidence from market analysis and biodiversity science indicates that the decline in output from the pharmaceutical sector since the mid-1980s can be attributed to a move away from natural product exploration ( " bioprospecting " ) in favor of genomics and synthetic chemistry , indeed claims about the value of undiscovered pharmaceuticals may not provide enough incentive for companies in free markets to search for them because of the high cost of development ; meanwhile , natural products have a long history of supporting significant economic and health innovation . marine ecosystems are particularly important , although inappropriate bioprospecting can increase biodiversity loss , as well as violating the laws of the communities and states from which the resources are taken .
predators may increase the biodiversity of communities by preventing a single species from becoming dominant . such predators are known as keystone species and may have a profound influence on the balance of organisms in a particular ecosystem . introduction or removal of this predator , or changes in its population density , can have drastic cascading effects on the equilibrium of many other populations in the ecosystem . for example , grazers of a grassland may prevent a single dominant species from taking over .
after being lit at the birthplace of the olympic games in olympia , greece on march 24 , the torch traveled to the panathinaiko stadium in athens , and then to beijing , arriving on march 31 . from beijing , the torch was following a route passing through six continents . the torch has visited cities along the silk road , symbolizing ancient links between china and the rest of the world . the relay also included an ascent with the flame to the top of mount everest on the border of nepal and tibet , china from the chinese side , which was closed specially for the event .
the end of adolescence and the beginning of adulthood varies by country and by function . furthermore , even within a single nation state or culture there can be different ages at which an individual is considered ( chronologically and legally ) mature enough for society to entrust them with certain privileges and responsibilities . such milestones include driving a vehicle , having legal sexual relations , serving in the armed forces or on a jury , purchasing and drinking alcohol , voting , entering into contracts , finishing certain levels of education , and marriage . adolescence is usually accompanied by an increased independence allowed by the parents or legal guardians , including less supervision as compared to preadolescence .
to create green sparks , fireworks use barium salts , such as barium chlorate , barium nitrate crystals , or barium chloride , also used for green fireplace logs . copper salts typically burn blue , but cupric chloride ( also known as " campfire blue " ) can also produce green flames . green pyrotechnic flares can use a mix ratio 75:25 of boron and potassium nitrate . smoke can be turned green by a mixture : solvent yellow 33 , solvent green 3 , lactose , magnesium carbonate plus sodium carbonate added to potassium chlorate .
bermuda 's national cricket team participated in the cricket world cup 2007 in the west indies . their most famous player is a 130 kilograms ( 290 lb ) police officer named dwayne leverock . but india defeated bermuda and set a record of 413 runs in a one-day international ( odi ) . bermuda were knocked out of the world cup . also very well-known is david hemp , a former captain of glamorgan in english first class cricket . the annual " cup match " cricket tournament between rival parishes st george 's in the east and somerset in the west is the occasion for a popular national holiday . this tournament began in 1872 when captain moresby of the royal navy introduced the game to bermuda , holding a match at somerset to mark forty years since the unjust thraldom of slavery . the east end versus west end rivalry resulted from the locations of the st. george 's garrison ( the original army headquarters in bermuda ) on barrack hill , st. george 's , and the royal naval dockyard at ireland island . moresby founded the somerset cricket club which plays the st. george 's cricket club in this game ( the membership of both clubs has long been mostly civilian ) .
however , leeches and their closest relatives have a body structure that is very uniform within the group but significantly different from that of other annelids , including other members of the clitellata . in leeches there are no septa , the connective tissue layer of the body wall is so thick that it occupies much of the body , and the two coelomata are widely separated and run the length of the body . they function as the main blood vessels , although they are side-by-side rather than upper and lower . however , they are lined with mesothelium , like the coelomata and unlike the blood vessels of other annelids . leeches generally use suckers at their front and rear ends to move like inchworms . the anus is on the upper surface of the pygidium .
the dynasty was founded by the jurchen aisin gioro clan in manchuria . in the late sixteenth century , nurhaci , originally a ming vassal , began organizing jurchen clans into " banners " , military-social units . nurhaci formed these clans into a unified entity , the subjects of which became known collectively as the manchu people . by 1636 , his son hong taiji began driving ming forces out of liaodong and declared a new dynasty , the qing . in 1644 , peasant rebels led by li zicheng conquered the ming capital beijing . rather than serve them , ming general wu sangui made an alliance with the manchus and opened the shanhai pass to the banner armies led by prince dorgon , who defeated the rebels and seized beijing . the conquest of china proper was not completed until 1683 under the kangxi emperor ( r. 1661–1722 ) . the ten great campaigns of the qianlong emperor from the 1750s to the 1790s extended qing control into central asia . while the early rulers maintained their manchu ways , and while their official title was emperor they were known as khans to the mongols and patronized tibetan buddhism , they governed using confucian styles and institutions of bureaucratic government . they retained the imperial examinations to recruit han chinese to work under or in parallel with manchus . they also adapted the ideals of the tributary system in international relations , and in places such as taiwan , the qing so-called internal foreign policy closely resembled colonial policy and control .
hydrogen production technologies been a significant area of solar chemical research since the 1970s . aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells , several thermochemical processes have also been explored . one such route uses concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures ( 2,300–2,600 °c or 4,200–4,700 °f ) . another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the steam reformation of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods . thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production . the solzinc process under development at the weizmann institute uses a 1 mw solar furnace to decompose zinc oxide ( zno ) at temperatures above 1,200 °c ( 2,200 °f ) . this initial reaction produces pure zinc , which can subsequently be reacted with water to produce hydrogen .
united nations ' secretary-general ban ki-moon has said that " renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity " . in october 2011 , he " announced the creation of a high-level group to drum up support for energy access , energy efficiency and greater use of renewable energy . the group is to be co-chaired by kandeh yumkella , the chair of un energy and director general of the un industrial development organisation , and charles holliday , chairman of bank of america " .
the town of stalybridge in cheshire is thought to have the pubs with both the longest and shortest names in the united kingdom — the old 13th cheshire rifleman corps inn and the q inn .
before creation of warsaw pact , fearing germany rearmed , czechoslovak leadership sought to create security pact with east germany and poland . these states protested strongly against re-militarization of west germany . the warsaw pact was primarily put in place as a consequence of the rearming of west germany inside nato . soviet leaders , as many european countries in both western and eastern side , feared germany being once again a military power as a direct threat and german militarism remained a fresh memory among soviets and eastern europeans . as soviet union had already bilateral treaties with all of its eastern satellites , the pact has been long considered 'superfluous ' , and because of the rushed way in which it was conceived , nato officials labeled it as a 'cardboard castle ' . previously , in march 1954 , the ussr , fearing the restoration of german militarism in west germany , requested admission to nato .
recent research indicates that the specialized animals that formed complex ecosystems , with high biodiversity , complex food webs and a variety of niches , took much longer to reestablish , recovery did not begin until the start of the mid-triassic , 4m to 6m years after the extinction and was not complete until 30m years after the permian–triassic extinction event . animal life was then dominated by various archosaurian reptiles : dinosaurs , pterosaurs , and aquatic reptiles such as ichthyosaurs , plesiosaurs , and mosasaurs .
mexico ’ s capital is both the oldest capital city in the americas and one of two founded by amerindians ( native americans ) , the other being quito . the city was originally built on an island of lake texcoco by the aztecs in 1325 as tenochtitlan , which was almost completely destroyed in the 1521 siege of tenochtitlan , and subsequently redesigned and rebuilt in accordance with the spanish urban standards . in 1524 , the municipality of mexico city was established , known as méxico tenochtitlán , and as of 1585 it was officially known as ciudad de méxico ( mexico city ) . mexico city served as the political , administrative and financial center of a major part of the spanish colonial empire . after independence from spain was achieved , the federal district was created in 1824 .
the portuguese found the island uninhabited , with an abundance of trees and fresh water . they imported livestock , fruit trees and vegetables , and built a chapel and one or two houses . though they formed no permanent settlement , the island was an important rendezvous point and source of food for ships travelling from asia to europe , and frequently sick mariners were left on the island to recover , before taking passage on the next ship to call on the island .
graduation rates among district-run schools , meanwhile , have steadily increased in the last ten years . in 2005 , philadelphia had a district graduation rate of 52 % . this number has increased to 65 % in 2014 , still below the national and state averages . scores on the state 's standardized test , the pennsylvania system of school assessment ( pssa ) have trended upward from 2005 to 2011 but have decreased since . in 2005 , the district-run schools scored an average of 37.4 % on math and 35.5 % on reading . the city 's schools reached its peak scores in 2011 with 59.0 % on math and 52.3 % on reading . in 2014 , the scores dropped significantly to 45.2 % on math and 42.0 % on reading .
tucson was probably first visited by paleo-indians , known to have been in southern arizona about 12,000 years ago . recent archaeological excavations near the santa cruz river have located a village site dating from 2100 bc . [ citation needed ] the floodplain of the santa cruz river was extensively farmed during the early agricultural period , circa 1200 bc to ad 150 . these people constructed irrigation canals and grew corn , beans , and other crops while gathering wild plants and hunting . the early ceramic period occupation of tucson saw the first extensive use of pottery vessels for cooking and storage . the groups designated as the hohokam lived in the area from ad 600 to 1450 and are known for their vast irrigation canal systems and their red-on-brown pottery .

neolithic peoples in the levant , anatolia , syria , northern mesopotamia and central asia were also accomplished builders , utilizing mud-brick to construct houses and villages . at çatal höyük , houses were plastered and painted with elaborate scenes of humans and animals . in europe , long houses built from wattle and daub were constructed . elaborate tombs were built for the dead . these tombs are particularly numerous in ireland , where there are many thousand still in existence . neolithic people in the british isles built long barrows and chamber tombs for their dead and causewayed camps , henges , flint mines and cursus monuments . it was also important to figure out ways of preserving food for future months , such as fashioning relatively airtight containers , and using substances like salt as preservatives .
west 's life took a different direction when his mother , donda west , died of complications from cosmetic surgery involving abdominoplasty and breast reduction in november 2007 . months later , west and fiancée alexis phifer ended their engagement and their long-term intermittent relationship , which had begun in 2002 . the events profoundly affected west , who set off for his 2008 glow in the dark tour shortly thereafter . purportedly because his emotions could not be conveyed through rapping , west decided to sing using the voice audio processor auto-tune , which would become a central part of his next effort . west had previously experimented with the technology on his debut album the college dropout for the background vocals of " jesus walks " and " never let me down . " recorded mostly in honolulu , hawaii in three weeks , west announced his fourth album , 808s & heartbreak , at the 2008 mtv video music awards , where he performed its lead single , " love lockdown " . music audiences were taken aback by the uncharacteristic production style and the presence of auto-tune , which typified the pre-release response to the record .
the georgics ' tone wavers between optimism and pessimism , sparking critical debate on the poet 's intentions , but the work lays the foundations for later didactic poetry . virgil and maecenas are said to have taken turns reading the georgics to octavian upon his return from defeating antony and cleopatra at the battle of actium in 31 bc .
soon lutyens started considering other places . indeed , the delhi town planning committee , set up to plan the new imperial capital , with george swinton as chairman and john a. brodie and lutyens as members , submitted reports for both north and south sites . however , it was rejected by the viceroy when the cost of acquiring the necessary properties was found to be too high . the central axis of new delhi , which today faces east at india gate , was previously meant to be a north-south axis linking the viceroy 's house at one end with paharganj at the other . during the project 's early years , many tourists believed it was a gate from earth to heaven itself . eventually , owing to space constraints and the presence of a large number of heritage sites in the north side , the committee settled on the south site . a site atop the raisina hill , formerly raisina village , a meo village , was chosen for the rashtrapati bhawan , then known as the viceroy 's house . the reason for this choice was that the hill lay directly opposite the dinapanah citadel , which was also considered the site of indraprastha , the ancient region of delhi . subsequently , the foundation stone was shifted from the site of delhi durbar of 1911–1912 , where the coronation pillar stood , and embedded in the walls of the forecourt of the secretariat . the rajpath , also known as king 's way , stretched from the india gate to the rashtrapati bhawan . the secretariat building , the two blocks of which flank the rashtrapati bhawan and houses ministries of the government of india , and the parliament house , both designed by herbert baker , are located at the sansad marg and run parallel to the rajpath .
in 2009 , former british prime minister tony blair picked yale as one location – the others are britain 's durham university and universiti teknologi mara – for the tony blair faith foundation 's united states faith and globalization initiative . as of 2009 , former mexican president ernesto zedillo is the director of the yale center for the study of globalization and teaches an undergraduate seminar , " debating globalization " . as of 2009 , former presidential candidate and dnc chair howard dean teaches a residential college seminar , " understanding politics and politicians . " also in 2009 , an alliance was formed among yale , university college london , and both schools ’ affiliated hospital complexes to conduct research focused on the direct improvement of patient care—a growing field known as translational medicine . president richard levin noted that yale has hundreds of other partnerships across the world , but " no existing collaboration matches the scale of the new partnership with ucl " .
the war had also brought to an end the " old system " of alliances in europe , in the years after the war , under the direction of lord sandwich , the british did try to re-establish this system . but after her surprising grand success against a coalition of great powers , european states such as austria , the dutch republic , sweden , denmark-norway , ottoman empire , and russia now saw britain as a greater threat than france and did not join them , while the prussians were angered by what they considered a british betrayal in 1762 . consequently , when the american war of independence turned into a global war between 1778–83 , britain found itself opposed by a strong coalition of european powers , and lacking any substantial ally .
in february 2007 , the u.s. mint , under the presidential $ 1 coin act of 2005 , introduced a new $ 1 u.s. presidential dollar coin . based on the success of the " 50 state quarters " series , the new coin features a sequence of presidents in order of their inaugurations , starting with george washington , on the obverse side . the reverse side features the statue of liberty . to allow for larger , more detailed portraits , the traditional inscriptions of " e pluribus unum " , " in god we trust " , the year of minting or issuance , and the mint mark will be inscribed on the edge of the coin instead of the face . this feature , similar to the edge inscriptions seen on the british £1 coin , is not usually associated with u.s. coin designs . the inscription " liberty " has been eliminated , with the statue of liberty serving as a sufficient replacement . in addition , due to the nature of u.s. coins , this will be the first time there will be circulating u.s. coins of different denominations with the same president featured on the obverse ( heads ) side ( lincoln/penny , jefferson/nickel , franklin d. roosevelt/dime , washington/quarter , kennedy/half dollar , and eisenhower/dollar ) . another unusual fact about the new $ 1 coin is grover cleveland will have two coins with his portrait issued due to the fact he was the only u.s. president to be elected to two non-consecutive terms .
mass production of glass window panes in the early twentieth century caused a similar effect . in glass factories , molten glass was poured onto a large cooling table and allowed to spread . the resulting glass is thicker at the location of the pour , located at the center of the large sheet . these sheets were cut into smaller window panes with nonuniform thickness , typically with the location of the pour centered in one of the panes ( known as " bull's-eyes " ) for decorative effect . modern glass intended for windows is produced as float glass and is very uniform in thickness .
chapter i covers animal husbandry and plant breeding , going back to ancient egypt . darwin discusses contemporary opinions on the origins of different breeds under cultivation to argue that many have been produced from common ancestors by selective breeding . as an illustration of artificial selection , he describes fancy pigeon breeding , noting that " [ t ] he diversity of the breeds is something astonishing " , yet all were descended from one species of rock pigeon . darwin saw two distinct kinds of variation : ( 1 ) rare abrupt changes he called " sports " or " monstrosities " ( example : ancon sheep with short legs ) , and ( 2 ) ubiquitous small differences ( example : slightly shorter or longer bill of pigeons ) . both types of hereditary changes can be used by breeders . however , for darwin the small changes were most important in evolution .
von neumann 's mathematical analysis of the structure of self-replication preceded the discovery of the structure of dna . in a short list of facts about his life he submitted to the national academy of sciences , he stated " the part of my work i consider most essential is that on quantum mechanics , which developed in göttingen in 1926 , and subsequently in berlin in 1927–1929 . also , my work on various forms of operator theory , berlin 1930 and princeton 1935–1939 ; on the ergodic theorem , princeton , 1931–1932 . "
the basis of simpson 's unity is color and colonial subjection . his color chart recognizes a spectrum of black , brown and yellow , which at the time had been traditional since the late 19th century . apart from these was " the great white race " , which the moderate simpson tones down to simply the white race . the great whites were appearing as late as the 1920s works of james henry breasted , which were taught as the gospel of ancient history throughout the entire first half of the 20th century . a red wavelength was mainly of interest in america . the eastern question was modified by simpson to " the problem of the nearer east , " which had nothing to do with the ottomans but everything to do with british colonialism . simpson wrote of the white man :
as computers grew in speed and capability , a number of general-purpose database systems emerged ; by the mid-1960s a number of such systems had come into commercial use . interest in a standard began to grow , and charles bachman , author of one such product , the integrated data store ( ids ) , founded the " database task group " within codasyl , the group responsible for the creation and standardization of cobol . in 1971 the database task group delivered their standard , which generally became known as the " codasyl approach " , and soon a number of commercial products based on this approach entered the market .
in scherer 's components processing model of emotion , five crucial elements of emotion are said to exist . from the component processing perspective , emotion experience is said to require that all of these processes become coordinated and synchronized for a short period of time , driven by appraisal processes . although the inclusion of cognitive appraisal as one of the elements is slightly controversial , since some theorists make the assumption that emotion and cognition are separate but interacting systems , the component processing model provides a sequence of events that effectively describes the coordination involved during an emotional episode .
in 1988 , with that preliminary phase of the project completed , professor skousen took over as editor and head of the farms critical text of the book of mormon project and proceeded to gather still scattered fragments of the original manuscript of the book of mormon and to have advanced photographic techniques applied to obtain fine readings from otherwise unreadable pages and fragments . he also closely examined the printer ’ s manuscript ( owned by the community of christ—rlds church in independence , missouri ) for differences in types of ink or pencil , in order to determine when and by whom they were made . he also collated the various editions of the book of mormon down to the present to see what sorts of changes have been made through time .
in 1211 , the jewish community in the country was strengthened by the arrival of a group headed by over 300 rabbis from france and england , among them rabbi samson ben abraham of sens . nachmanides , the 13th-century spanish rabbi and recognised leader of jewry greatly praised the land of israel and viewed its settlement as a positive commandment incumbent on all jews . he wrote " if the gentiles wish to make peace , we shall make peace and leave them on clear terms ; but as for the land , we shall not leave it in their hands , nor in the hands of any nation , not in any generation . "
the gregorian reform contained two parts : a reform of the julian calendar as used prior to pope gregory xiii 's time and a reform of the lunar cycle used by the church , with the julian calendar , to calculate the date of easter . the reform was a modification of a proposal made by aloysius lilius . his proposal included reducing the number of leap years in four centuries from 100 to 97 , by making 3 out of 4 centurial years common instead of leap years . lilius also produced an original and practical scheme for adjusting the epacts of the moon when calculating the annual date of easter , solving a long-standing obstacle to calendar reform .
rapid decompression can be much more dangerous than vacuum exposure itself . even if the victim does not hold his or her breath , venting through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the fatal rupture of the delicate alveoli of the lungs . eardrums and sinuses may be ruptured by rapid decompression , soft tissues may bruise and seep blood , and the stress of shock will accelerate oxygen consumption leading to hypoxia . injuries caused by rapid decompression are called barotrauma . a pressure drop of 13 kpa ( 100 torr ) , which produces no symptoms if it is gradual , may be fatal if it occurs suddenly .
the animistic idea as the representation of the imaginative reality , is sanctified in the homeric poems and in greek myths , in stories of the god hephaestus ( phaistos ) and the mythic daedalus ( the builder of the labyrinth ) that made images which moved of their own accord . this kind of art goes back to the minoan period , when its main theme was the representation of motion in a specific moment . these free-standing statues were usually marble , but also the form rendered in limestone , bronze , ivory and terracotta .
the mosaics of the church of st stephen in ancient kastron mefaa ( now umm ar-rasas ) were made in 785 ( discovered after 1986 ) . the perfectly preserved mosaic floor is the largest one in jordan . on the central panel hunting and fishing scenes are depicted while another panel illustrates the most important cities of the region . the frame of the mosaic is especially decorative . six mosaic masters signed the work : staurachios from esbus , euremios , elias , constantinus , germanus and abdela . it overlays another , damaged , mosaic floor of the earlier ( 587 ) " church of bishop sergius . " another four churches were excavated nearby with traces of mosaic decoration .
armenia was annexed by bolshevist russia and along with georgia and azerbaijan , it was incorporated into the soviet union as part of the transcaucasian sfsr ( tsfsr ) on 4 march 1922 . with this annexation , the treaty of alexandropol was superseded by the turkish-soviet treaty of kars . in the agreement , turkey allowed the soviet union to assume control over adjara with the port city of batumi in return for sovereignty over the cities of kars , ardahan , and iğdır , all of which were part of russian armenia .
on the origin of species was first published on thursday 24 november 1859 , priced at fifteen shillings with a first printing of 1250 copies . the book had been offered to booksellers at murray 's autumn sale on tuesday 22 november , and all available copies had been taken up immediately . in total , 1,250 copies were printed but after deducting presentation and review copies , and five for stationers ' hall copyright , around 1,170 copies were available for sale . significantly , 500 were taken by mudie 's library , ensuring that the book promptly reached a large number of subscribers to the library . the second edition of 3,000 copies was quickly brought out on 7 january 1860 , and incorporated numerous corrections as well as a response to religious objections by the addition of a new epigraph on page ii , a quotation from charles kingsley , and the phrase " by the creator " added to the closing sentence . during darwin 's lifetime the book went through six editions , with cumulative changes and revisions to deal with counter-arguments raised . the third edition came out in 1861 , with a number of sentences rewritten or added and an introductory appendix , an historical sketch of the recent progress of opinion on the origin of species , while the fourth in 1866 had further revisions . the fifth edition , published on 10 february 1869 , incorporated more changes and for the first time included the phrase " survival of the fittest " , which had been coined by the philosopher herbert spencer in his principles of biology ( 1864 ) .
in the 16th century political and religious changes altered the attitude of historians towards john . tudor historians were generally favourably inclined towards the king , focusing on john 's opposition to the papacy and his promotion of the special rights and prerogatives of a king . revisionist histories written by john foxe , william tyndale and robert barnes portrayed john as an early protestant hero , and john foxe included the king in his book of martyrs . john speed 's historie of great britaine in 1632 praised john 's " great renown " as a king ; he blamed the bias of medieval chroniclers for the king 's poor reputation .
symbiotic relationships include those associations in which one organism lives on another ( ectosymbiosis , such as mistletoe ) , or where one partner lives inside the other ( endosymbiosis , such as lactobacilli and other bacteria in humans or symbiodinium in corals ) . symbiosis is also classified by physical attachment of the organisms ; symbiosis in which the organisms have bodily union is called conjunctive symbiosis , and symbiosis in which they are not in union is called disjunctive symbiosis .
the annual united states open tennis championships is one of the world 's four grand slam tennis tournaments and is held at the national tennis center in flushing meadows-corona park , queens . the new york marathon is one of the world 's largest , and the 2004–2006 events hold the top three places in the marathons with the largest number of finishers , including 37,866 finishers in 2006 . the millrose games is an annual track and field meet whose featured event is the wanamaker mile . boxing is also a prominent part of the city 's sporting scene , with events like the amateur boxing golden gloves being held at madison square garden each year . the city is also considered the host of the belmont stakes , the last , longest and oldest of horse racing 's triple crown races , held just over the city 's border at belmont park on the first or second sunday of june . the city also hosted the 1932 u.s. open golf tournament and the 1930 and 1939 pga championships , and has been host city for both events several times , most notably for nearby winged foot golf club .
for hayek , the supposedly stark difference between authoritarianism and totalitarianism has much importance and hayek places heavy weight on this distinction in his defence of transitional dictatorship . for example , when hayek visited venezuela in may 1981 , he was asked to comment on the prevalence of totalitarian regimes in latin america . in reply , hayek warned against confusing " totalitarianism with authoritarianism , " and said that he was unaware of " any totalitarian governments in latin america . the only one was chile under allende " . for hayek , however , the word 'totalitarian ' signifies something very specific : the want to “ organize the whole of society ” to attain a “ definite social goal ” —which is stark in contrast to “ liberalism and individualism ” .
alpine symbolism has played an essential role in shaping the history of the country and the swiss national identity . nowadays some concentrated mountain areas have a strong highly energetic ski resort culture in winter , and a hiking ( ger : das wandern ) or mountain biking culture in summer . other areas throughout the year have a recreational culture that caters to tourism , yet the quieter seasons are spring and autumn when there are fewer visitors . a traditional farmer and herder culture also predominates in many areas and small farms are omnipresent outside the cities . folk art is kept alive in organisations all over the country . in switzerland it is mostly expressed in music , dance , poetry , wood carving and embroidery . the alphorn , a trumpet-like musical instrument made of wood , has become alongside yodeling and the accordion an epitome of traditional swiss music .
mianyang hi-tech industrial development zone was established in 1992 , with a planned area of 43 km2 ( 17 sq mi ) . the zone is situated 96 kilometers away from chengdu , and is 8 km ( 5.0 mi ) away from mianyang airport . since its establishment , the zone accumulated 177.4 billion yuan of industrial output , 46.2 billion yuan of gross domestic product , fiscal revenue 6.768 billion yuan . there are more than 136 high-tech enterprises in the zone and they accounted for more than 90 % of the total industrial output .
scientists associated with byu have created some notable inventions . philo t. farnsworth , inventor of the electronic television , received his education at byu , and later returned to do fusion research , receiving an honorary degree from the university . harvey fletcher , also an alumnus of byu , inventor of stereophonic sound , went on to carry out the now famous oil-drop experiment with robert millikan , and was later founding dean of the byu college of engineering . h. tracy hall , inventor of the man-made diamond , left general electric in 1955 and became a full professor of chemistry and director of research at byu . while there , he invented a new type of diamond press , the tetrahedral press . in student achievements , byu ad lab teams won both the 2007 and 2008 l'oréal national brandstorm competition , and students developed the magnetic lasso algorithm found in adobe photoshop . in prestigious scholarships , byu has produced 10 rhodes scholars , four gates scholars in the last six years , and in the last decade has claimed 41 fulbright scholars and 3 jack kent cooke scholars .
public bus services within the city are provided by the national bus operator bus éireann . city routes are numbered from 201 through to 219 and connect the city centre to the principal suburbs , colleges , shopping centres and places of interest . two of these bus routes provide orbital services across the northern and southern districts of the city respectively . buses to the outer suburbs , such as ballincollig , glanmire , midleton and carrigaline are provided from the city 's bus terminal at parnell place in the city centre . suburban services also include shuttles to cork airport , and a park and ride facility in the south suburbs only .
the functions of the brain depend on the ability of neurons to transmit electrochemical signals to other cells , and their ability to respond appropriately to electrochemical signals received from other cells . the electrical properties of neurons are controlled by a wide variety of biochemical and metabolic processes , most notably the interactions between neurotransmitters and receptors that take place at synapses .
in the united states , non-caucasian lgbt individuals may find themselves in a double minority , where they are neither fully accepted or understood by mainly caucasian lgbt communities , nor are they accepted by their own ethnic group . many people experience racism in the dominant lgbt community where racial stereotypes merge with gender stereotypes , such that asian-american lgbts are viewed as more passive and feminine , while african-american lgbts are viewed as more masculine and aggressive . there are a number of culturally specific support networks for lgbt individuals active in the united states . for example , " ô-môi " for vietnamese american queer females .
in 2003 , harding earley follmer & frailey defended a client from a trademark dispute using the archive 's wayback machine . the attorneys were able to demonstrate that the claims made by the plaintiff were invalid , based on the content of their web site from several years prior . the plaintiff , healthcare advocates , then amended their complaint to include the internet archive , accusing the organization of copyright infringement as well as violations of the dmca and the computer fraud and abuse act . healthcare advocates claimed that , since they had installed a robots.txt file on their web site , even if after the initial lawsuit was filed , the archive should have removed all previous copies of the plaintiff web site from the wayback machine . the lawsuit was settled out of court .
niels bohr introduced the first quantized model of the atom in 1913 , in an attempt to overcome a major shortcoming of rutherford 's classical model . in classical electrodynamics , a charge moving in a circle should radiate electromagnetic radiation . if that charge were to be an electron orbiting a nucleus , the radiation would cause it to lose energy and spiral down into the nucleus . bohr solved this paradox with explicit reference to planck 's work : an electron in a bohr atom could only have certain defined energies en
some clock-shift problems could be avoided by adjusting clocks continuously or at least more gradually—for example , willett at first suggested weekly 20-minute transitions—but this would add complexity and has never been implemented .
many groups continued their hunter-gatherer ways of life , although their numbers have continually declined , partly as a result of pressure from growing agricultural and pastoral communities . many of them reside in the developing world , either in arid regions or tropical forests . areas that were formerly available to hunter-gatherers were—and continue to be—encroached upon by the settlements of agriculturalists . in the resulting competition for land use , hunter-gatherer societies either adopted these practices or moved to other areas . in addition , jared diamond has blamed a decline in the availability of wild foods , particularly animal resources . in north and south america , for example , most large mammal species had gone extinct by the end of the pleistocene—according to diamond , because of overexploitation by humans , although the overkill hypothesis he advocates is strongly contested . [ by whom ? ]
in addition there are two service bells , cast by robert mot , in 1585 and 1598 respectively , a sanctus bell cast in 1738 by richard phelps and thomas lester and two unused bells—one cast about 1320 , by the successor to r de wymbish , and a second cast in 1742 , by thomas lester . the two service bells and the 1320 bell , along with a fourth small silver " dish bell " , kept in the refectory , have been noted as being of historical importance by the church buildings council of the church of england .
on january 7 , 2012 , beyoncé gave birth to a daughter , blue ivy carter , at lenox hill hospital in new york under heavy security . two days later , jay z released " glory " , a song dedicated to their child , on his website lifeandtimes.com . the song detailed the couple 's pregnancy struggles , including a miscarriage beyoncé suffered before becoming pregnant with blue ivy . blue ivy 's cries are included at the end of the song , and she was officially credited as " b.i.c . " on it . at two days old , she became the youngest person ever to appear on a billboard chart when " glory " debuted on the hot r & b/hip-hop songs chart .
many us and european jewellery companies , including bulgari , tiffany , and cartier , refuse to import these stones based on reports of deplorable working conditions in the mines . human rights watch has encouraged a complete ban on the purchase of burmese gems based on these reports and because nearly all profits go to the ruling junta , as the majority of mining activity in the country is government-run . the government of myanmar controls the gem trade by direct ownership or by joint ventures with private owners of mines .
so an additional problem beyond canceling the unwanted reactance is of matching the remaining resistive impedance to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line . in principle this can always be done with a transformer , however the turns ratio of a transformer is not adjustable . a general matching network with at least two adjustments can be made to correct both components of impedance . matching networks using discrete inductors and capacitors will have losses associated with those components , and will have power restrictions when used for transmitting . avoiding these difficulties , commercial antennas are generally designed with fixed matching elements or feeding strategies to get an approximate match to standard coax , such as 50 or 75 ohms . antennas based on the dipole ( rather than vertical antennas ) should include a balun in between the transmission line and antenna element , which may be integrated into any such matching network .
in august 2007 virgil griffith , a caltech computation and neural-systems graduate student , created a searchable database that linked changes made by anonymous wikipedia editors to companies and organizations from which the changes were made . the database cross-referenced logs of wikipedia edits with publicly available records pertaining to the internet ip addresses edits were made from . griffith was motivated by the edits from the united states congress , and wanted to see if others were similarly promoting themselves . the tool was designed to detect conflict of interest edits . among his findings were that fbi computers were used to edit the fbi article in wikipedia . although the edits correlated with known fbi ip addresses , there was no proof that the changes actually came from a member or employee of the fbi , only that someone who had access to their network had edited the fbi article in wikipedia . wikipedia spokespersons received griffith 's " wikiscanner " positively , noting that it helped prevent conflicts of interest from influencing articles as well as increasing transparency and mitigating attempts to remove or distort relevant facts .
byu offers programs in liberal arts , engineering , agriculture , management , physical and mathematical sciences , nursing and law . the university is broadly organized into 11 colleges or schools at its main provo campus , with certain colleges and divisions defining their own admission standards . the university also administers two satellite campuses , one in jerusalem and one in salt lake city , while its parent organization , the church educational system ( ces ) , sponsors sister schools in hawaii and idaho . the university 's primary focus is on undergraduate education , but it also has 68 master 's and 25 doctoral degree programs .
in his book , the greatest show on earth : the evidence for evolution , biologist richard dawkins grapples with the question of why pain has to be so very painful . he describes the alternative as a simple , mental raising of a " red flag " . to argue why that red flag might be insufficient , dawkins explains that drives must compete with each other within living beings . the most fit creature would be the one whose pains are well balanced . those pains which mean certain death when ignored will become the most powerfully felt . the relative intensities of pain , then , may resemble the relative importance of that risk to our ancestors ( lack of food , too much cold , or serious injuries are felt as agony , whereas minor damage is felt as mere discomfort ) . this resemblance will not be perfect , however , because natural selection can be a poor designer . the result is often glitches in animals , including supernormal stimuli . such glitches help explain pains which are not , or at least no longer directly adaptive ( e.g . perhaps some forms of toothache , or injury to fingernails ) .
albrecht von roon , the prussian minister of war from 1859 to 1873 , put into effect a series of reforms of the prussian military system in the 1860s . among these were two major reforms that substantially increased the military power of germany . the first was a reorganization of the army that integrated the regular army and the landwehr reserves . the second was the provision for the conscription of every male prussian of military age in the event of mobilization . thus , despite the population of france being greater than the population of all of the german states that participated in the war , the germans mobilized more soldiers for battle .
queen composed music that drew inspiration from many different genres of music , often with a tongue-in-cheek attitude . the genres they have been associated with include progressive rock , symphonic rock , art rock , glam rock , hard rock , heavy metal , pop rock , and psychedelic rock . queen also wrote songs that were inspired by diverse musical styles which are not typically associated with rock groups , such as opera , music hall , folk music , gospel , ragtime , and dance/disco . several queen songs were written with audience participation in mind , such as " we will rock you " and " we are the champions " . similarly , " radio ga ga " became a live favourite because it would have " crowds clapping like they were at a nuremberg rally " .
in 2001 , she became the first african-american woman and second woman songwriter to win the pop songwriter of the year award at the american society of composers , authors , and publishers pop music awards . beyoncé was the third woman to have writing credits on three number one songs ( " irreplaceable " , " grillz " and " check on it " ) in the same year , after carole king in 1971 and mariah carey in 1991 . she is tied with american songwriter diane warren at third with nine songwriting credits on number-one singles .

after the 1980s , the use of the " canadian armed forces " name gave way to " canadian forces " ; [ citation needed ] the " canadian armed forces " name returned in 2013 .
amtrak 's northeast corridor and chicago lines originate at south station , which serves as a major intermodal transportation hub , and stop at back bay . fast northeast corridor trains , which serve new york city , washington , d.c. , and points in between , also stop at route 128 station in the southwestern suburbs of boston . meanwhile , amtrak 's downeaster service to maine originates at north station , despite the current lack of a dedicated passenger rail link between the two railhubs , other than the " t " subway lines .
at the start of a classic valley glacier is a bowl-shaped cirque , which has escarped walls on three sides but is open on the side that descends into the valley . cirques are where ice begins to accumulate in a glacier . two glacial cirques may form back to back and erode their backwalls until only a narrow ridge , called an arête is left . this structure may result in a mountain pass . if multiple cirques encircle a single mountain , they create pointed pyramidal peaks ; particularly steep examples are called horns .
both languages are still largely mutually intelligible , although this relation can in some fields ( such as lexicon , spelling and grammar ) be asymmetric , as it is easier for dutch speakers to understand written afrikaans than it is for afrikaans speakers to understand written dutch . afrikaans is grammatically far less complex than dutch , and vocabulary items are generally altered in a clearly patterned manner , e.g . vogel becomes voël ( " bird " ) and regen becomes reën ( " rain " ) . in south africa , the number of students following dutch at university , is difficult to estimate , since the academic study of afrikaans inevitably includes the study of dutch . elsewhere in the world , the number of people learning dutch is relatively small .
there are many approaches available in software testing . reviews , walkthroughs , or inspections are referred to as static testing , whereas actually executing programmed code with a given set of test cases is referred to as dynamic testing . static testing is often implicit , as proofreading , plus when programming tools/text editors check source code structure or compilers ( pre-compilers ) check syntax and data flow as static program analysis . dynamic testing takes place when the program itself is run . dynamic testing may begin before the program is 100 % complete in order to test particular sections of code and are applied to discrete functions or modules . typical techniques for this are either using stubs/drivers or execution from a debugger environment .
there are many missionary groups operating in the country , including lutherans , baptists , catholics , grace brethren , and jehovah 's witnesses . while these missionaries are predominantly from the united states , france , italy , and spain , many are also from nigeria , the democratic republic of the congo , and other african countries . large numbers of missionaries left the country when fighting broke out between rebel and government forces in 2002–3 , but many of them have now returned to continue their work .
when a usb device is first connected to a usb host , the usb device enumeration process is started . the enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the usb device . the data rate of the usb device is determined during the reset signaling . after reset , the usb device 's information is read by the host and the device is assigned a unique 7-bit address . if the device is supported by the host , the device drivers needed for communicating with the device are loaded and the device is set to a configured state . if the usb host is restarted , the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices .
despite the small land mass , place names are repeated ; there are , for example , two islands named long island , three bays named long bay ( on somerset , main , and cooper 's islands ) , two horseshoe bays ( one in southampton , on the main island , the other at morgan 's point , formerly tucker 's island ) , there are two roads through cuttings called khyber pass ( one in warwick , the other in st. george 's parish ) , and st george 's town is located on st george 's island within st george 's parish ( each known as st george 's ) . there is a hamilton parish in addition to the city of hamilton ( which is in pembroke parish ) .
the united states accused manuel noriega 's government in panama of being a " narcokleptocracy " , a corrupt government profiting on illegal drug trade . later the u.s. invaded panama and captured noriega .
there is disagreement whether madaris ever became universities . scholars like arnold h. green and seyyed hossein nasr have argued that starting in the 10th century , some medieval islamic madaris indeed became universities . george makdisi and others , however , argue that the european university has no parallel in the medieval islamic world . darleen pryds questions this view , pointing out that madaris and european universities in the mediterranean region shared similar foundations by princely patrons and were intended to provide loyal administrators to further the rulers ' agenda . other scholars regard the university as uniquely european in origin and characteristics .
the charleston-north charleston-summerville metropolitan statistical area consists of three counties : charleston , berkeley , and dorchester . as of the 2013 u.s. census , the metropolitan statistical area had a total population of 712,239 people . north charleston is the second-largest city in the charleston-north charleston-summerville metropolitan statistical area and ranks as the third-largest city in the state ; mount pleasant and summerville are the next-largest cities . these cities combined with other incorporated and unincorporated areas along with the city of charleston form the charleston-north charleston urban area with a population of 548,404 as of 2010 . the metropolitan statistical area also includes a separate and much smaller urban area within berkeley county , moncks corner ( with a 2000 population of 9,123 ) .
the extreme and stressful climatic conditions give way to the growth of plant species with secondary metabolites important for medicinal purposes . origanum vulgare , prunella vulgaris , solanum nigrum and urtica dioica are some of the more useful medicinal species found in the alps .
the u.s. war department created the first antecedent of the u.s. air force in 1907 , which through a succession of changes of organization , titles , and missions advanced toward eventual separation 40 years later . in world war ii , almost 68,000 u.s airmen died helping to win the war ; only the infantry suffered more enlisted casualties . in practice , the u.s. army air forces ( usaaf ) was virtually independent of the army during world war ii , but officials wanted formal independence . the national security act of 1947 was signed on on 26 july 1947 by president harry s truman , which established the department of the air force , but it was not not until 18 september 1947 , when the first secretary of the air force , w. stuart symington was sworn into office that the air force was officially formed .
many sleeping birds bend their heads over their backs and tuck their bills in their back feathers , although others place their beaks among their breast feathers . many birds rest on one leg , while some may pull up their legs into their feathers , especially in cold weather . perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them hold on to the perch when they are asleep . many ground birds , such as quails and pheasants , roost in trees . a few parrots of the genus loriculus roost hanging upside down . some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates . this physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species , including owlet-nightjars , nightjars , and woodswallows . one species , the common poorwill , even enters a state of hibernation . birds do not have sweat glands , but they may cool themselves by moving to shade , standing in water , panting , increasing their surface area , fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves .
the fa cup winners qualify for the following season 's uefa europa league ( formerly named the uefa cup ; until 1998 they entered the cup winners ' cup instead ) . this european place applies even if the team is relegated or is not in the english top flight . in the past , if the fa cup winning team also qualified for the following season 's champions league or europa league through their league position , then the losing fa cup finalist was given the europa league place instead . fa cup winners enter the europa league at the group stage . losing finalists , if they entered the europa league , began earlier , at the play-off or third qualifying round stage . from the 2015–16 uefa europa league season , however , uefa will not allow the runners-up to qualify for the europa league through the competition .
on the other hand , orthodox jews subscribing to modern orthodoxy in its american and uk incarnations , tend to be far more right-wing than both non-orthodox and other orthodox jews . while the overwhelming majority of non-orthodox american jews are on average strongly liberal and supporters of the democratic party , the modern orthodox subgroup of orthodox judaism tends to be far more conservative , with roughly half describing themselves as political conservatives , and are mostly republican party supporters . modern orthodox jews , compared to both the non-orthodox american jewry and the haredi and hasidic jewry , also tend to have a stronger connection to israel due to their attachment to zionism .
until march 1 , 2009 , the borough president of the bronx was adolfo carrión jr. , elected as a democrat in 2001 and 2005 before retiring early to direct the white house office of urban affairs policy . his successor , democratic new york state assembly member rubén díaz , jr. , who won a special election on april 21 , 2009 by a vote of 86.3 % ( 29,420 ) on the " bronx unity " line to 13.3 % ( 4,646 ) for the republican district leader anthony ribustello on the " people first " line , became borough president on may 1 .
the modern domesticated turkey is descended from one of six subspecies of wild turkey ( meleagris gallopavo ) found in the present mexican states of jalisco , guerrero and veracruz . pre-aztec tribes in south-central mexico first domesticated the bird around 800 bc , and pueblo indians inhabiting the colorado plateau in the united states did likewise around 200 bc . they used the feathers for robes , blankets , and ceremonial purposes . more than 1,000 years later , they became an important food source . the first europeans to encounter the bird misidentified it as a guineafowl , a bird known as a " turkey fowl " at that time because it had been introduced into europe via turkey .
hospitals in liberia include the john f. kennedy medical center in monrovia and several others . life expectancy in liberia is estimated to be 57.4 years in 2012 . with a fertility rate of 5.9 births per woman , the maternal mortality rate stood at 990 per 100,000 births in 2010 . a number of highly communicable diseases are widespread , including tuberculosis , diarrheal diseases and malaria . in 2007 , the hiv infection rates stood at 2 % of the population aged 15–49 whereas the incidence of tuberculosis was 420 per 100,000 people in 2008 . approximately 58.2 % – 66 % of women are estimated to have undergone female genital mutilation .
absolute idealism is g. w. f. hegel 's account of how existence is comprehensible as an all-inclusive whole . hegel called his philosophy " absolute " idealism in contrast to the " subjective idealism " of berkeley and the " transcendental idealism " of kant and fichte , which were not based on a critique of the finite and a dialectical philosophy of history as hegel 's idealism was . the exercise of reason and intellect enables the philosopher to know ultimate historical reality , the phenomenological constitution of self-determination , the dialectical development of self-awareness and personality in the realm of history .
from the second half of the 20th century on parties which continued to rely on donations or membership subscriptions ran into mounting problems . along with the increased scrutiny of donations there has been a long-term decline in party memberships in most western democracies which itself places more strains on funding . for example , in the united kingdom and australia membership of the two main parties in 2006 is less than an 1/8 of what it was in 1950 , despite significant increases in population over that period .
however questions still remain , as some of the corrupt government officials have still not been brought to justice , while the many families who lost their only child , are still seeking compensation and justice to what had happened . according to the times , many parents were warned by the government not to stage a protest under the threat of arrest .
another misunderstanding is that , by her immaculate conception , mary did not need a saviour . when defining the dogma in ineffabilis deus , pope pius ix explicitly affirmed that mary was redeemed in a manner more sublime . he stated that mary , rather than being cleansed after sin , was completely prevented from contracting original sin in view of the foreseen merits of jesus christ , the savior of the human race . in luke 1:47 , mary proclaims : " my spirit has rejoiced in god my saviour . " this is referred to as mary 's pre-redemption by christ . since the second council of orange against semi-pelagianism , the catholic church has taught that even had man never sinned in the garden of eden and was sinless , he would still require god 's grace to remain sinless .
the first six presidents of the united states did not make extensive use of the veto power : george washington only vetoed two bills , james monroe one , and john adams , thomas jefferson and john quincy adams none . james madison , a firm believer in a strong executive , vetoed seven bills . none of the first six presidents , however , used the veto to direct national policy . it was andrew jackson , the seventh president , who was the first to use the veto as a political weapon . during his two terms in office , he vetoed twelve bills—more than all of his predecessors combined . furthermore , he defied the supreme court in enforcing the policy of ethnically cleansing native american tribes ( " indian removal " ) ; he stated ( perhaps apocryphally ) , " john marshall has made his decision . now let him enforce it ! "
in 1950 , whites represented 94.7 % of boston 's population . from the 1950s to the end of the 20th century , the proportion of non-hispanic whites in the city declined ; in 2000 , non-hispanic whites made up 49.5 % of the city 's population , making the city majority-minority for the first time . however , in recent years the city has experienced significant gentrification , in which affluent whites have moved into formerly non-white areas . in 2006 , the us census bureau estimated that non-hispanic whites again formed a slight majority . but as of 2010 , in part due to the housing crash , as well as increased efforts to make more affordable housing more available , the minority population has rebounded . this may also have to do with an increased latino population and more clarity surrounding us census statistics , which indicate a non-hispanic white population of 47 percent ( some reports give slightly lower figures ) .
music was a major part of everyday life . [ citation needed ] the word itself derives from greek μουσική ( mousike ) , " ( art ) of the muses " . many private and public events were accompanied by music , ranging from nightly dining to military parades and manoeuvres . in a discussion of any ancient music , however , non-specialists and even many musicians have to be reminded that much of what makes our modern music familiar to us is the result of developments only within the last 1,000 years ; thus , our ideas of melody , scales , harmony , and even the instruments we use may not have been familiar to romans who made and listened to music many centuries earlier .

in the early hours of 7 december ( hawaiian time ) , japan launched a major surprise carrier-based air strike on pearl harbor without explicit warning , which crippled the u.s. pacific fleet , leaving eight american battleships out of action , 188 american aircraft destroyed , and 2,403 american citizens dead . at the time of the attack , the u.s. was not officially at war anywhere in the world , which means that the people killed or property destroyed at pearl harbor by the japanese attack had a non-combatant status . [ nb 11 ] the japanese had gambled that the united states , when faced with such a sudden and massive blow , would agree to a negotiated settlement and allow japan free rein in asia . this gamble did not pay off . american losses were less serious than initially thought : the american aircraft carriers , which would prove to be more important than battleships , were at sea , and vital naval infrastructure ( fuel oil tanks , shipyard facilities , and a power station ) , submarine base , and signals intelligence units were unscathed . japan 's fallback strategy , relying on a war of attrition to make the u.s. come to terms , was beyond the ijn 's capabilities .
in the 7th–9th centuries rome fell under the influence of byzantine art , noticeable on the mosaics of santa prassede , santa maria in domnica , sant'agnese fuori le mura , santa cecilia in trastevere , santi nereo e achilleo and the san venanzio chapel of san giovanni in laterano . the great dining hall of pope leo iii in the lateran palace was also decorated with mosaics . they were all destroyed later except for one example , the so-called triclinio leoniano of which a copy was made in the 18th century . another great work of pope leo , the apse mosaic of santa susanna , depicted christ with the pope and charlemagne on one side , and ss . susanna and felicity on the other . it was plastered over during a renovation in 1585 . pope paschal i ( 817–824 ) embellished the church of santo stefano del cacco with an apsidal mosaic which depicted the pope with a model of the church ( destroyed in 1607 ) .
while many secular buildings exist from the late middle ages , it is in the buildings of cathedrals and great churches that gothic architecture displays its pertinent structures and characteristics to the fullest advantage . a gothic cathedral or abbey was , prior to the 20th century , generally the landmark building in its town , rising high above all the domestic structures and often surmounted by one or more towers and pinnacles and perhaps tall spires . these cathedrals were the skyscrapers of that day and would have been the largest buildings by far that europeans would ever have seen . it is in the architecture of these gothic churches that a unique combination of existing technologies established the emergence of a new building style . those technologies were the ogival or pointed arch , the ribbed vault , and the buttress .
the use of the term middle east as a region of international affairs apparently began in british and american diplomatic circles quite independently of each other over concern for the security of the same country : iran , then known to the west as persia . in 1900 thomas edward gordon published an article , the problem of the middle east , which began :
among ike 's objectives in not directly confronting mccarthy was to prevent mccarthy from dragging the atomic energy commission ( aec ) into mccarthy 's witch hunt for communists , which would interfere with , and perhaps delay , the aec 's important work on h-bombs . the administration had discovered through its own investigations that one of the leading scientists on the aec , j. robert oppenheimer , had urged that the h-bomb work be delayed . eisenhower removed him from the agency and revoked his security clearance , though he knew this would create fertile ground for mccarthy .
according to the endurance running hypothesis , long-distance running as in persistence hunting , a method still practiced by some hunter-gatherer groups in modern times , was likely the driving evolutionary force leading to the evolution of certain human characteristics . this hypothesis does not necessarily contradict the scavenging hypothesis : both subsistence strategies could have been in use – sequentially , alternating or even simultaneously .
the atlantic ocean has less influence on the climate of the piedmont region , which has hotter summers and colder winters than in the coast . daytime highs in the piedmont often reach over 90 °f ( 32 °c ) in the summer . while it is not common for the temperature to reach over 100 °f ( 38 °c ) in the state , such temperatures , when they occur , typically are found only in the lower-elevation areas of the piedmont and far-inland areas of the coastal plain . the weaker influence of the atlantic ocean also means that temperatures in the piedmont often fluctuate more widely than in the coast .
greece has universal health care . in a 2000 world health organization report , its health care system ranked 14th in overall performance of 191 countries surveyed . in a 2013 save the children report , greece was ranked the 19th best country ( out of 176 countries surveyed ) for the state of mothers and newborn babies . in 2010 , there were 138 hospitals with 31,000 beds in the country , but on 1 july 2011 , the ministry for health and social solidarity announced its plans to decrease the number to 77 hospitals with 36,035 beds , as a necessary reform to reduce expenses and further enhance healthcare standards . [ disputed – discuss ] greece 's healthcare expenditures as a percentage of gdp were 9.6 % in 2007 according to a 2011 oecd report , just above the oecd average of 9.5 % . the country has the largest number of doctors-to-population ratio of any oecd country .
hemimetabolous insects , those with incomplete metamorphosis , change gradually by undergoing a series of molts . an insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton , which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect 's growth . the molting process begins as the insect 's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside the old one . after this new epicuticle is secreted , the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle . when this stage is complete , the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air , which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest . :142
as of 2010 , those of ( non-hispanic white ) european ancestry accounted for 57.9 % of florida 's population . out of the 57.9 % , the largest groups were 12.0 % german ( 2,212,391 ) , 10.7 % irish ( 1,979,058 ) , 8.8 % english ( 1,629,832 ) , 6.6 % italian ( 1,215,242 ) , 2.8 % polish ( 511,229 ) , and 2.7 % french ( 504,641 ) . white americans of all european backgrounds are present in all areas of the state . in 1970 , non-hispanic whites were nearly 80 % of florida 's population . those of english and irish ancestry are present in large numbers in all the urban/suburban areas across the state . some native white floridians , especially those who have descended from long-time florida families , may refer to themselves as " florida crackers " ; others see the term as a derogatory one . like whites in most of the other southern states , they descend mainly from english and scots-irish settlers , as well as some other british american settlers .
at the level of the individual , there is a large literature , generally related to the work of jacob mincer , on how earnings are related to the schooling and other human capital . this work has motivated a large number of studies , but is also controversial . the chief controversies revolve around how to interpret the impact of schooling . some students who have indicated a high potential for learning , by testing with a high intelligence quotient , may not achieve their full academic potential , due to financial difficulties .

the assembly consisted of nine seats , with electors casting nine equal votes , of which no more than two could be given to any individual candidate . it is a method of voting called a " weighted first past the post system " . four of the members of the assembly formed the executive council , which devised policy and acted as an advisory body to the administrator . the last chief minister of norfolk island was lisle snell . other ministers included : minister for tourism , industry and development ; minister for finance ; minister for cultural heritage and community services ; and minister for environment .
tucson is located 118 mi ( 190 km ) southeast of phoenix and 60 mi ( 97 km ) north of the united states - mexico border . the 2010 united states census puts the city 's population at 520,116 with a metropolitan area population at 980,263 . in 2009 , tucson ranked as the 32nd largest city and 52nd largest metropolitan area in the united states . a major city in the arizona sun corridor , tucson is the largest city in southern arizona , the second largest in the state after phoenix . it is also the largest city in the area of the gadsden purchase . as of 2015 , the greater tucson metro area has exceeded a population of 1 million .
along with the desire for independence , tensions between hindus and muslims had also been developing over the years . the muslims had always been a minority within the subcontinent , and the prospect of an exclusively hindu government made them wary of independence ; they were as inclined to mistrust hindu rule as they were to resist the foreign raj , although gandhi called for unity between the two groups in an astonishing display of leadership . the british , extremely weakened by the second world war , promised that they would leave and participated in the formation of an interim government . the british indian territories gained independence in 1947 , after being partitioned into the union of india and dominion of pakistan . following the controversial division of pre-partition punjab and bengal , rioting broke out between sikhs , hindus and muslims in these provinces and spread to several other parts of india , leaving some 500,000 dead . also , this period saw one of the largest mass migrations ever recorded in modern history , with a total of 12 million hindus , sikhs and muslims moving between the newly created nations of india and pakistan ( which gained independence on 15 and 14 august 1947 respectively ) . in 1971 , bangladesh , formerly east pakistan and east bengal , seceded from pakistan .

based on the strength of his work , universal signed spielberg to do four tv films . the first was a richard matheson adaptation called duel . the film is about a psychotic peterbilt 281 tanker truck driver who chases the terrified driver ( dennis weaver ) of a small plymouth valiant and tries to run him off the road . special praise of this film by the influential british critic dilys powell was highly significant to spielberg 's career . another tv film ( something evil ) was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of the exorcist , then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film . he fulfilled his contract by directing the tv film-length pilot of a show called savage , starring martin landau . spielberg 's debut full-length feature film was the sugarland express , about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby . spielberg 's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers , and the hollywood reporter stated that " a major new director is on the horizon . " :223 however , the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release .
hellenistic military equipment was generally characterized by an increase in size . hellenistic-era warships grew from the trireme to include more banks of oars and larger numbers of rowers and soldiers as in the quadrireme and quinquereme . the ptolemaic tessarakonteres was the largest ship constructed in antiquity . new siege engines were developed during this period . an unknown engineer developed the torsion-spring catapult ( ca . 360 ) and dionysios of alexandria designed a repeating ballista , the polybolos . preserved examples of ball projectiles range from 4.4 kg to 78 kg ( or over 170 lbs ) . demetrius poliorcetes was notorious for the large siege engines employed in his campaigns , especially during the 12-month siege of rhodes when he had epimachos of athens build a massive 160 ton siege tower named helepolis , filled with artillery .
the church of the holy apostles in thessaloniki was built in 1310–14 . although some vandal systematically removed the gold tesserae of the background it can be seen that the pantokrator and the prophets in the dome follow the traditional byzantine pattern . many details are similar to the pammakaristos mosaics so it is supposed that the same team of mosaicists worked in both buildings . another building with a related mosaic decoration is the theotokos paregoritissa church in arta . the church was established by the despot of epirus in 1294–96 . in the dome is the traditional stern pantokrator , with prophets and cherubim below .

by the start of the 20th century , germany and the united states challenged britain 's economic lead . subsequent military and economic tensions between britain and germany were major causes of the first world war , during which britain relied heavily upon its empire . the conflict placed enormous strain on the military , financial and manpower resources of britain . although the british empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after world war i , britain was no longer the world 's pre-eminent industrial or military power . in the second world war , britain 's colonies in south-east asia were occupied by imperial japan . despite the final victory of britain and its allies , the damage to british prestige helped to accelerate the decline of the empire . india , britain 's most valuable and populous possession , achieved independence as part of a larger decolonisation movement in which britain granted independence to most territories of the empire . the transfer of hong kong to china in 1997 marked for many the end of the british empire . fourteen overseas territories remain under british sovereignty . after independence , many former british colonies joined the commonwealth of nations , a free association of independent states . the united kingdom is now one of 16 commonwealth nations , a grouping known informally as the commonwealth realms , that share one monarch—queen elizabeth ii .

the first major extension of new delhi outside of lutyens ' delhi came in the 1950s when the central public works department ( cpwd ) developed a large area of land southwest of lutyens ' delhi to create the diplomatic enclave of chanakyapuri , where land was allotted for embassies , chanceries , high commissions and residences of ambassadors , around wide central vista , shanti path .
rex stout 's fictional detective nero wolfe is described as fond of solving the london times ' crossword puzzle at his new york home , in preference to those of american papers .
the french breech-loading rifle , the chassepot , had a far longer range than the german needle gun ; 1,500 yards ( 1,400 m ) compared to 600 yd ( 550 m ) . the french also had an early machine-gun type weapon , the mitrailleuse , which could fire its thirty-seven barrels at a range of around 1,200 yd ( 1,100 m ) . it was developed in such secrecy , that little training with the weapon had occurred , leaving french gunners with no experience ; the gun was treated like artillery and in this role it was ineffective . worse still , once the small number of soldiers who had been trained how to use the new weapon became casualties , there were no replacements who knew how to operate the mitrailleuse .
in the eastern empire the slow infiltration of the balkans by the slavs added a further difficulty for justinian 's successors . it began gradually , but by the late 540s slavic tribes were in thrace and illyrium , and had defeated an imperial army near adrianople in 551 . in the 560s the avars began to expand from their base on the north bank of the danube ; by the end of the 6th century they were the dominant power in central europe and routinely able to force the eastern emperors to pay tribute . they remained a strong power until 796 . an additional problem to face the empire came as a result of the involvement of emperor maurice ( r. 582–602 ) in persian politics when he intervened in a succession dispute . this led to a period of peace , but when maurice was overthrown , the persians invaded and during the reign of emperor heraclius ( r. 610–641 ) controlled large chunks of the empire , including egypt , syria , and asia minor , until heraclius ' successful counterattack . in 628 the empire secured a peace treaty and recovered all of its lost territories .
portuguese cuisine is diverse . the portuguese consume a lot of dry cod ( bacalhau in portuguese ) , for which there are hundreds of recipes . there are more than enough bacalhau dishes for each day of the year . two other popular fish recipes are grilled sardines and caldeirada , a potato-based stew that can be made from several types of fish . typical portuguese meat recipes , that may be made out of beef , pork , lamb , or chicken , include cozido à portuguesa , feijoada , frango de churrasco , leitão ( roast suckling pig ) and carne de porco à alentejana . a very popular northern dish is the arroz de sarrabulho ( rice stewed in pigs blood ) or the arroz de cabidela ( rice and chickens meat stewed in chickens blood ) .
pharmaceutical companies whose products are used in the three-drug cocktails for lethal injections are predominantly european , and they have strenuously objected to the use of their drugs for executions and taken steps to prevent their use . for example , hospira , the sole american manufacturer of sodium thiopental , the critical anesthetic in the three-drug cocktail , announced in 2011 that it would no longer manufacture the drug for the american market , in part for ethical reasons and in part because its transfer of sodium thiopental manufacturing to italy would subject it to the european union 's torture regulation , which forbids the use of any product manufactured within the union for torture ( as execution by lethal injection is considered by the regulation ) . since the drug manufacturers began taking these steps and the eu regulation ended the importation of drugs produced in europe , the resulting shortage of execution drugs has led to or influenced decisions to impose moratoria in arkansas , california , kentucky , louisiana , mississippi , montana , nevada , north carolina , and tennessee .
as with the spoken languages , the ethnic group composition also remains a point of debate , mainly regarding the largest and second largest ethnic groups , the persians and azerbaijanis , due to the lack of iranian state censuses based on ethnicity . the cia 's world factbook has estimated that around 79 % of the population of iran are a diverse indo-european ethno-linguistic group that comprise the speakers of iranian languages , with persians constituting 53 % of the population , gilaks and mazanderanis 7 % , kurds 10 % , lurs 6 % , and balochs 2 % . peoples of the other ethnicities in iran make up the remaining 22 % , with azerbaijanis constituting 16 % , arabs 2 % , turkmens and turkic tribes 2 % , and others 2 % ( such as armenians , talysh , georgians , circassians , assyrians ) .
the occupy wall street protests in zuccotti park in the financial district of lower manhattan began on september 17 , 2011 , receiving global attention and spawning the occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide .
the united states army ( usa ) is the largest branch of the united states armed forces and performs land-based military operations . it is one of the seven uniformed services of the united states and is designated as the army of the united states in the united states constitution , article 2 , section 2 , clause 1 and united states code , title 10 , subtitle b , chapter 301 , section 3001 . as the largest and senior branch of the u.s. military , the modern u.s. army has its roots in the continental army , which was formed ( 14 june 1775 ) to fight the american revolutionary war ( 1775–83 ) —before the u.s. was established as a country . after the revolutionary war , the congress of the confederation created the united states army on 3 june 1784 , to replace the disbanded continental army . the united states army considers itself descended from the continental army , and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775 .
while the churches eventually worked out their differences and came to an initial agreement , both nicholas i of russia and napoleon iii refused to back down . nicholas issued an ultimatum that the orthodox subjects of the empire be placed under his protection . britain attempted to mediate , and arranged a compromise that nicholas agreed to . when the ottomans demanded changes , nicholas refused and prepared for war . having obtained promises of support from france and britain , the ottomans officially declared war on russia in october 1853 .
a . a. luce and john foster are other subjectivists . luce , in sense without matter ( 1954 ) , attempts to bring berkeley up to date by modernizing his vocabulary and putting the issues he faced in modern terms , and treats the biblical account of matter and the psychology of perception and nature . foster 's the case for idealism argues that the physical world is the logical creation of natural , non-logical constraints on human sense-experience . foster 's latest defense of his views is in his book a world for us : the case for phenomenalistic idealism .
oklahoma is located in a humid subtropical region . oklahoma lies in a transition zone between humid continental climate to the north , semi-arid climate to the west , and humid subtropical climate in the central , south and eastern portions of the state . most of the state lies in an area known as tornado alley characterized by frequent interaction between cold , dry air from canada , warm to hot , dry air from mexico and the southwestern u.s. , and warm , moist air from the gulf of mexico . the interactions between these three contrasting air currents produces severe weather ( severe thunderstorms , damaging thunderstorm winds , large hail and tornadoes ) with a frequency virtually unseen anywhere else on planet earth . an average 62 tornadoes strike the state per year—one of the highest rates in the world .
as the 10th century progressed , the khazars were no longer able to command tribute from the volga bulgars , and their relationship with the byzantines deteriorated , as byzantium increasingly allied with the pechenegs against them . the pechenegs were thus secure to raid the lands of the khazars from their base between the volga and don rivers , allowing them to expand to the west . rus ' relations with the pechenegs were complex , as the groups alternately formed alliances with and against one another . the pechenegs were nomads roaming the steppe raising livestock which they traded with the rus ' for agricultural goods and other products . the lucrative rus ' trade with the byzantine empire had to pass through pecheneg-controlled territory , so the need for generally peaceful relations was essential . nevertheless , while the primary chronicle reports the pechenegs entering rus ' territory in 915 and then making peace , they were waging war with one another again in 920 . pechenegs are reported assisting the rus ' in later campaigns against the byzantines , yet allied with the byzantines against the rus ' at other times .
by the late middle ages , great britain was separated into the kingdoms of england and scotland . power in ireland fluxed between gaelic kingdoms , hiberno-norman lords and the english-dominated lordship of ireland . a similar situation existed in the principality of wales , which was slowly being annexed into the kingdom of england by a series of laws . during the course of the 15th century , the crown of england would assert a claim to the crown of france , thereby also releasing the king of england as from being vassal of the king of france . in 1534 , king henry viii , at first having been a strong defender of roman catholicism in the face of the reformation , separated from the roman church after failing to secure a divorce from the pope . his response was to place the king of england as " the only supreme head in earth of the church of england " , thereby removing the authority of the pope from the affairs of the english church . ireland , which had been held by the king of england as lord of ireland , but which strictly speaking had been a feudal possession of the pope since the norman invasion was declared a separate kingdom in personal union with england .
universal music group decided not to renew their contract with the itunes store on july 3 , 2007 . universal will now supply itunes in an 'at will ' capacity .
objections to banning the use of incandescent light bulbs include the higher initial cost of alternatives and lower quality of light of fluorescent lamps . some people have concerns about the health effects of fluorescent lamps . however , even though they contain mercury , the environmental performance of cfls is much better than that of light bulbs , mostly because they consume much less energy and therefore strongly reduce the environmental impact of power production . led lamps are even more efficient , and are free of mercury . they are regarded as the best solution in terms of cost effectiveness and robustness .
the preserved records of the reichssicherheitshauptamt ( the reich security main office ) show the persecution of freemasons during the holocaust . rsha amt vii ( written records ) was overseen by professor franz six and was responsible for " ideological " tasks , by which was meant the creation of antisemitic and anti-masonic propaganda . while the number is not accurately known , it is estimated that between 80,000 and 200,000 freemasons were killed under the nazi regime . masonic concentration camp inmates were graded as political prisoners and wore an inverted red triangle .
henry viii assumed direct royal control in 1539 and granted the abbey the status of a cathedral by charter in 1540 , simultaneously issuing letters patent establishing the diocese of westminster . by granting the abbey cathedral status henry viii gained an excuse to spare it from the destruction or dissolution which he inflicted on most english abbeys during this period .
in 1937 , ibm 's tabulating equipment enabled organizations to process unprecedented amounts of data , its clients including the u.s. government , during its first effort to maintain the employment records for 26 million people pursuant to the social security act , and the third reich , largely through the german subsidiary dehomag . during the second world war the company produced small arms for the american war effort ( m1 carbine , and browning automatic rifle ) . ibm provided translation services for the nuremberg trials . in 1947 , ibm opened its first office in bahrain , as well as an office in saudi arabia to service the needs of the arabian-american oil company that would grow to become saudi business machines ( sbm ) .
electrochemical migration ( ecm ) is the growth of conductive metal filaments on or in a printed circuit board ( pcb ) under the influence of a dc voltage bias . silver , zinc , and aluminum are known to grow whiskers under the influence of an electric field . silver also grows conducting surface paths in the presence of halide and other ions , making it a poor choice for electronics use . tin will grow " whiskers " due to tension in the plated surface . tin-lead or solder plating also grows whiskers , only reduced by the percentage tin replaced . reflow to melt solder or tin plate to relieve surface stress lowers whisker incidence . another coating issue is tin pest , the transformation of tin to a powdery allotrope at low temperature .
the nazis , led by adolf hitler , attempted to unite all the people they claimed were " germans " ( volksdeutsche ) into one realm , including ethnic germans in eastern europe , many of whom had emigrated more than one hundred fifty years before and developed separate cultures in their new lands . this idea was initially welcomed by many ethnic germans in sudetenland , austria , poland , danzig and western lithuania , particularly the germans from klaipeda ( memel ) . the swiss resisted the idea . they had viewed themselves as a distinctly separate nation since the peace of westphalia of 1648 .
as of 2010 [ update ] , 79.12 % ( 1,112,441 ) of philadelphia residents age 5 and older spoke english at home as a primary language , while 9.72 % ( 136,688 ) spoke spanish , 1.64 % ( 23,075 ) chinese , 0.89 % ( 12,499 ) vietnamese , 0.77 % ( 10,885 ) russian , 0.66 % ( 9,240 ) french , 0.61 % ( 8,639 ) other asian languages , 0.58 % ( 8,217 ) african languages , 0.56 % ( 7,933 ) cambodian ( mon-khmer ) , and italian was spoken as a main language by 0.55 % ( 7,773 ) of the population over the age of five . in total , 20.88 % ( 293,544 ) of philadelphia 's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than english .
the second part of the novel deals with what book reviewer harding lemay termed " the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white southerner in the treatment of the negro " . in the years following its release , many reviewers considered to kill a mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations . claudia durst johnson considers it " reasonable to believe " that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in alabama : rosa parks ' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person , which sparked the 1955 montgomery bus boycott , and the 1956 riots at the university of alabama after autherine lucy and polly myers were admitted ( myers eventually withdrew her application and lucy was expelled , but reinstated in 1980 ) . in writing about the historical context of the novel 's construction , two other literary scholars remark : " to kill a mockingbird was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the south since the civil war and reconstruction . inevitably , despite its mid-1930s setting , the story told from the perspective of the 1950s voices the conflicts , tensions , and fears induced by this transition . "
the first example is taken from the opening lines of the folk-epic beowulf , a poem of some 3,000 lines and the single greatest work of old english . this passage describes how hrothgar 's legendary ancestor scyld was found as a baby , washed ashore , and adopted by a noble family . the translation is literal and represents the original poetic word order . as such , it is not typical of old english prose . the modern cognates of original words have been used whenever practical to give a close approximation of the feel of the original poem .
starting in 1982 , dividends from the fund 's annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible alaskans , ranging from an initial $ 1,000 in 1982 ( equal to three years ' payout , as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme ) to $ 3,269 in 2008 ( which included a one-time $ 1,200 " resource rebate " ) . every year , the state legislature takes out 8 % from the earnings , puts 3 % back into the principal for inflation proofing , and the remaining 5 % is distributed to all qualifying alaskans . to qualify for the permanent fund dividend , one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months , maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences , and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment .
religious beliefs in the eastern empire and persia were in flux during the late 6th and early 7th centuries . judaism was an active proselytising faith , and at least one arab political leader converted to it . [ j ] christianity had active missions competing with the persians ' zoroastrianism in seeking converts , especially among residents of the arabian peninsula . all these strands came together with the emergence of islam in arabia during the lifetime of muhammad ( d. 632 ) . after his death , islamic forces conquered much of the eastern empire and persia , starting with syria in 634–635 and reaching egypt in 640–641 , persia between 637 and 642 , north africa in the later 7th century , and the iberian peninsula in 711 . by 714 , islamic forces controlled much of the peninsula in a region they called al-andalus .
since 1934 , the sale of federal duck stamps has generated $ 670 million , and helped to purchase or lease 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat . the stamps serve as a license to hunt migratory birds , an entrance pass for all national wildlife refuge areas , and are also considered collectors items often purchased for aesthetic reasons outside of the hunting and birding communities . although non-hunters buy a significant number of duck stamps , eighty-seven percent of their sales are contributed by hunters , which is logical , as hunters are required to purchase them . distribution of funds is managed by the migratory bird conservation commission ( mbcc ) .
to prevent further loss of groundwater , tucson has been involved in water conservation and groundwater preservation efforts , shifting away from its reliance on a series of tucson area wells in favor of conservation , consumption-based pricing for residential and commercial water use , and new wells in the more sustainable avra valley aquifer , northwest of the city . an allocation from the central arizona project aqueduct ( cap ) , which passes more than 300 mi ( 480 km ) across the desert from the colorado river , has been incorporated into the city 's water supply , annually providing over 20 million gallons of " recharged " water which is pumped into the ground to replenish water pumped out . since 2001 , cap water has allowed the city to remove or turn off over 80 wells .
on december 25 , 1991 , following the collapse of the soviet union , the republic was renamed the russian federation , which it remains to this day . this name and " russia " were specified as the official state names in the april 21 , 1992 amendment to the existing constitution and were retained as such in the 1993 constitution of russia .
the mosaics of the church of st stephen in ancient kastron mefaa ( now umm ar-rasas ) were made in 785 ( discovered after 1986 ) . the perfectly preserved mosaic floor is the largest one in jordan . on the central panel hunting and fishing scenes are depicted while another panel illustrates the most important cities of the region . the frame of the mosaic is especially decorative . six mosaic masters signed the work : staurachios from esbus , euremios , elias , constantinus , germanus and abdela . it overlays another , damaged , mosaic floor of the earlier ( 587 ) " church of bishop sergius . " another four churches were excavated nearby with traces of mosaic decoration .
in separate testimony to financial crisis inquiry commission , officers of clayton holdings—the largest residential loan due diligence and securitization surveillance company in the united states and europe—testified that clayton 's review of over 900,000 mortgages issued from january 2006 to june 2007 revealed that scarcely 54 % of the loans met their originators ’ underwriting standards . the analysis ( conducted on behalf of 23 investment and commercial banks , including 7 " too big to fail " banks ) additionally showed that 28 % of the sampled loans did not meet the minimal standards of any issuer . clayton 's analysis further showed that 39 % of these loans ( i.e . those not meeting any issuer 's minimal underwriting standards ) were subsequently securitized and sold to investors .
fighting on one side was a coalition of forces including the republic of vietnam ( south vietnam or the " rvn " ) , the united states , supplemented by south korea , thailand , australia , new zealand , and the philippines . the allies fought against the north vietnamese army ( nva ) as well as the national liberation front ( nlf , also known as viet communists viet cong ) , or " vc " , a guerrilla force within south vietnam . the nva received substantial military and economic aid from the soviet union and china , turning vietnam into a proxy war .
apollo 11 left lunar orbit and returned to earth , landing safely in the pacific ocean on july 24 , 1969 . when the spacecraft splashed down , 2,982 days had passed since kennedy 's commitment to landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth before the end of the decade ; the mission was completed with 161 days to spare . with the safe completion of the apollo 11 mission , the americans won the race to the moon .
smaller boats and ships typically have machine-guns or fast cannons , which can often be deadly to low-flying aircraft if linked to a radar-directed fire-control system radar-controlled cannon for point defence . some vessels like aegis cruisers are as much a threat to aircraft as any land-based air defence system . in general , naval vessels should be treated with respect by aircraft , however the reverse is equally true . carrier battle groups are especially well defended , as not only do they typically consist of many vessels with heavy air defence armament but they are also able to launch fighter jets for combat air patrol overhead to intercept incoming airborne threats .
on 2 march 1979 , the gpc announced the separation of government and revolution , the latter being represented by new revolutionary committees , who operated in tandem with the people 's committees in schools , universities , unions , the police force and the military . dominated by revolutionary zealots , the revolutionary committees were led by mohammad maghgoub and a central coordinating office , and met with gaddafi annually . publishing a weekly magazine the green march ( al-zahf al-akhdar ) , in october 1980 they took control of the press . responsible for perpetuating revolutionary fervour , they performed ideological surveillance , later adopting a significant security role , making arrests and putting people on trial according to the " law of the revolution " ( qanun al-thawra ) . with no legal code or safeguards , the administration of revolutionary justice was largely arbitrary and resulted in widespread abuses and the suppression of civil liberties : the " green terror . "
in 1454 king casimir iv granted the nieszawa statutes ( polish : " statuty cerkwicko-nieszawskie " ) , clarifying the legal basis of voivodship sejmiks ( local parliaments ) . the king could promulgate new laws , raise taxes , or call for a levée en masse ( pospolite ruszenie ) only with the consent of the sejmiks , and the nobility were protected from judicial abuses . the nieszawa statutes also curbed the power of the magnates , as the sejm ( national parliament ) received the right to elect many officials , including judges , voivods and castellans . these privileges were demanded by the szlachta as a compensation for their participation in the thirteen years ' war .
to begin with , england had no permanent home stadium . they joined fifa in 1906 and played their first ever games against countries other than the home nations on a tour of central europe in 1908 . wembley stadium was opened in 1923 and became their home ground . the relationship between england and fifa became strained , and this resulted in their departure from fifa in 1928 , before they rejoined in 1946 . as a result , they did not compete in a world cup until 1950 , in which they were beaten in a 1–0 defeat by the united states , failing to get past the first round in one of the most embarrassing defeats in the team 's history .
the story takes place during three years ( 1933–35 ) of the great depression in the fictional " tired old town " of maycomb , alabama , the seat of maycomb county . it focuses on six-year-old jean louise finch ( scout ) , who lives with her older brother , jem , and their widowed father , atticus , a middle-aged lawyer . jem and scout befriend a boy named dill , who visits maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer . the three children are terrified of , and fascinated by , their neighbor , the reclusive arthur " boo " radley . the adults of maycomb are hesitant to talk about boo , and , for many years few have seen him . the children feed one another 's imagination with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden , and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house . after two summers of friendship with dill , scout and jem find that someone leaves them small gifts in a tree outside the radley place . several times the mysterious boo makes gestures of affection to the children , but , to their disappointment , he never appears in person .
the dock connector also allowed the ipod to connect to accessories , which often supplement the ipod 's music , video , and photo playback . apple sells a few accessories , such as the now-discontinued ipod hi-fi , but most are manufactured by third parties such as belkin and griffin . some peripherals use their own interface , while others use the ipod 's own screen . because the dock connector is a proprietary interface , the implementation of the interface requires paying royalties to apple .
the status of " language " is not solely determined by linguistic criteria , but it is also the result of a historical and political development . romansh came to be a written language , and therefore it is recognized as a language , even though it is very close to the lombardic alpine dialects . an opposite example is the case of chinese , whose variations such as mandarin and cantonese are often called dialects and not languages , despite their mutual unintelligibility .
arsenal 's longest-running and deepest rivalry is with their nearest major neighbours , tottenham hotspur ; matches between the two are referred to as north london derbies . other rivalries within london include those with chelsea , fulham and west ham united . in addition , arsenal and manchester united developed a strong on-pitch rivalry in the late 1980s , which intensified in recent years when both clubs were competing for the premier league title – so much so that a 2003 online poll by the football fans census listed manchester united as arsenal 's biggest rivals , followed by tottenham and chelsea . a 2008 poll listed the tottenham rivalry as more important .
the slowing sales growth has been attributed to the maturing pc market , which constituted 66 % of dell 's sales , and analysts suggested that dell needed to make inroads into non-pc businesses segments such as storage , services and servers . dell 's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop pcs , but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company 's supply chain , and as competitors such as hewlett-packard and acer made their pc manufacturing operations more efficient to match dell , weakening dell 's traditional price differentiation . throughout the entire pc industry , declines in prices along with commensurate increases in performance meant that dell had fewer opportunities to upsell to their customers ( a lucrative strategy of encouraging buyers to upgrade the processor or memory ) . as a result , the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive pcs than before , which eroded profit margins . the laptop segment had become the fastest-growing of the pc market , but dell produced low-cost notebooks in china like other pc manufacturers which eliminated dell 's manufacturing cost advantages , plus dell 's reliance on internet sales meant that it missed out on growing notebook sales in big box stores . cnet has suggested that dell was getting trapped in the increasing commoditization of high volume low margin computers , which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers demanded .
circadian rhythms allow organisms to anticipate and prepare for precise and regular environmental changes . they thus enable organisms to best capitalize on environmental resources ( e.g . light and food ) compared to those that can not predict such availability . it has therefore been suggested that circadian rhythms put organisms at a selective advantage in evolutionary terms . however , rhythmicity appears to be as important in regulating and coordinating internal metabolic processes , as in coordinating with the environment . this is suggested by the maintenance ( heritability ) of circadian rhythms in fruit flies after several hundred generations in constant laboratory conditions , as well as in creatures in constant darkness in the wild , and by the experimental elimination of behavioral , but not physiological , circadian rhythms in quail .
anthropology is the study of humans and their societies in the past and present . its main subdivisions are social anthropology and cultural anthropology , which describes the workings of societies around the world , linguistic anthropology , which investigates the influence of language in social life , and biological or physical anthropology , which concerns long-term development of the human organism . archaeology , which studies past human cultures through investigation of physical evidence , is thought of as a branch of anthropology in the united states , while in europe , it is viewed as a discipline in its own right , or grouped under other related disciplines such as history .
following the death in 1473 of james ii , the last lusignan king , the republic of venice assumed control of the island , while the late king 's venetian widow , queen catherine cornaro , reigned as figurehead . venice formally annexed the kingdom of cyprus in 1489 , following the abdication of catherine . the venetians fortified nicosia by building the venetian walls , and used it as an important commercial hub . throughout venetian rule , the ottoman empire frequently raided cyprus . in 1539 the ottomans destroyed limassol and so fearing the worst , the venetians also fortified famagusta and kyrenia .
current governor of the reserve bank of india raghuram rajan had predicted the crisis in 2005 when he became chief economist at the international monetary fund.in 2005 , at a celebration honouring alan greenspan , who was about to retire as chairman of the us federal reserve , rajan delivered a controversial paper that was critical of the financial sector . in that paper , " has financial development made the world riskier ? " , rajan " argued that disaster might loom . " rajan argued that financial sector managers were encouraged to " take risks that generate severe adverse consequences with small probability but , in return , offer generous compensation the rest of the time . these risks are known as tail risks . but perhaps the most important concern is whether banks will be able to provide liquidity to financial markets so that if the tail risk does materialise , financial positions can be unwound and losses allocated so that the consequences to the real economy are minimised . "
with continuing european integration , the european union is increasingly being seen as a great power in its own right , with representation at the wto and at g8 and g-20 summits . this is most notable in areas where the european union has exclusive competence ( i.e . economic affairs ) . it also reflects a non-traditional conception of europe 's world role as a global " civilian power " , exercising collective influence in the functional spheres of trade and diplomacy , as an alternative to military dominance . the european union is a supranational union and not a sovereign state , and has limited scope in the areas of foreign affairs and defence policy . these remain largely with the member states of the european union , which include the three great powers of france , germany and the united kingdom ( referred to as the " eu three " ) .
filming started in austria in december 2014 , with production taking in the area around sölden—including the ötztal glacier road , rettenbach glacier and the adjacent ski resort and cable car station—and obertilliach and lake altaussee , before concluding in february 2015 . scenes filmed in austria centred on the ice q restaurant , standing in for the fictional hoffler klinik , a private medical clinic in the austrian alps . filming included an action scene featuring a land rover defender bigfoot and a range rover sport . production was temporarily halted first by an injury to craig , who sprained his knee whilst shooting a fight scene , and later by an accident involving a filming vehicle that saw three crew members injured , at least one of them seriously .
35th street runs from fdr drive to eleventh avenue . notable locations include east river ferry , laptopmd headquarters , mercy college manhattan campus , and jacob k. javits convention center .
the investigation of the transmitted signals started immediately after the launch of compass -m1 on 14 april 2007 . soon after in june 2007 , engineers at cnes reported the spectrum and structure of the signals . a month later , researchers from stanford university reported the complete decoding of the “ i ” signals components . the knowledge of the codes allowed a group of engineers at septentrio to build the compass receiver and report tracking and multipath characteristics of the “ i ” signals on e2 and e5b .
while most hokkien morphemes have standard designated characters , they are not always etymological or phono-semantic . similar-sounding , similar-meaning or rare characters are commonly borrowed or substituted to represent a particular morpheme . examples include " beautiful " ( 美 bí is the literary form ) , whose vernacular morpheme suí is represented by characters like 媠 ( an obsolete character ) , 婎 ( a vernacular reading of this character ) and even 水 ( transliteration of the sound suí ) , or " tall " ( 高 ko is the literary form ) , whose morpheme kôan is 懸 . common grammatical particles are not exempt ; the negation particle m̄ ( not ) is variously represented by 毋 , 呣 or 唔 , among others . in other cases , characters are invented to represent a particular morpheme ( a common example is the character 𪜶 in , which represents the personal pronoun " they " ) . in addition , some characters have multiple and unrelated pronunciations , adapted to represent hokkien words . for example , the hokkien word bah ( " meat " ) has been reduced to the character 肉 , which has etymologically unrelated colloquial and literary readings ( he̍k and jio̍k , respectively ) . another case is the word 'to eat , ' chia̍h , which is often transcribed in taiwanese newspapers and media as 呷 ( a mandarin transliteration , xiā , to approximate the hokkien term ) , even though its recommended character in dictionaries is 食 .

insects have segmented bodies supported by exoskeletons , the hard outer covering made mostly of chitin . the segments of the body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units , or tagmata : a head , a thorax and an abdomen . the head supports a pair of sensory antennae , a pair of compound eyes , and , if present , one to three simple eyes ( or ocelli ) and three sets of variously modified appendages that form the mouthparts . the thorax has six segmented legs—one pair each for the prothorax , mesothorax and the metathorax segments making up the thorax—and , none , two or four wings . the abdomen consists of eleven segments , though in a few species of insects , these segments may be fused together or reduced in size . the abdomen also contains most of the digestive , respiratory , excretory and reproductive internal structures . :22–48 considerable variation and many adaptations in the body parts of insects occur , especially wings , legs , antenna and mouthparts .
in 1528 the bishop lost secular power over both neder- and oversticht – which included the city of utrecht – to charles v , holy roman emperor . charles v combined the seventeen provinces ( the current benelux and the northern parts of france ) as a personal union . this ended the prince-bishopric utrecht , as the secular rule was now the lordship of utrecht , with the religious power remaining with the bishop , although charles v had gained the right to appoint new bishops . in 1559 the bishopric of utrecht was raised to archbishopric to make it the religious center of the northern ecclesiastical province in the seventeen provinces .
in ancient greece , the epics of homer , who wrote the iliad and the odyssey , and hesiod , who wrote works and days and theogony , are some of the earliest , and most influential , of ancient greek literature . classical greek genres included philosophy , poetry , historiography , comedies and dramas . plato and aristotle authored philosophical texts that are the foundation of western philosophy , sappho and pindar were influential lyric poets , and herodotus and thucydides were early greek historians . although drama was popular in ancient greece , of the hundreds of tragedies written and performed during the classical age , only a limited number of plays by three authors still exist : aeschylus , sophocles , and euripides . the plays of aristophanes provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as old comedy , the earliest form of greek comedy , and are in fact used to define the genre .

due to the expansion of trade and its geographical proximity , kiev became the most important trade centre and chief among the communes ; therefore the leader of kiev gained political " control " over the surrounding areas . this princedom emerged from a coalition of traditional patriarchic family communes banded together in an effort to increase the applicable workforce and expand the productivity of the land . this union developed the first major cities in the rus ' and was the first notable form of self-government . as these communes became larger , the emphasis was taken off the family holdings and placed on the territory that surrounded . this shift in ideology became known as the verv ' .

many scripts , including arabic and devanagari , have special orthographic rules that require certain combinations of letterforms to be combined into special ligature forms . the rules governing ligature formation can be quite complex , requiring special script-shaping technologies such as ace ( arabic calligraphic engine by decotype in the 1980s and used to generate all the arabic examples in the printed editions of the unicode standard ) , which became the proof of concept for opentype ( by adobe and microsoft ) , graphite ( by sil international ) , or aat ( by apple ) .

the 2nd edition ( 1787 ) contained a refutation of idealism to distinguish his transcendental idealism from descartes 's sceptical idealism and berkeley 's anti-realist strain of subjective idealism . the section paralogisms of pure reason is an implicit critique of descartes ' idealism . kant says that it is not possible to infer the 'i ' as an object ( descartes ' cogito ergo sum ) purely from " the spontaneity of thought " . kant focused on ideas drawn from british philosophers such as locke , berkeley and hume but distinguished his transcendental or critical idealism from previous varieties ;
when a person is non-verbal and can not self-report pain , observation becomes critical , and specific behaviors can be monitored as pain indicators . behaviors such as facial grimacing and guarding indicate pain , as well as an increase or decrease in vocalizations , changes in routine behavior patterns and mental status changes . patients experiencing pain may exhibit withdrawn social behavior and possibly experience a decreased appetite and decreased nutritional intake . a change in condition that deviates from baseline such as moaning with movement or when manipulating a body part , and limited range of motion are also potential pain indicators . in patients who possess language but are incapable of expressing themselves effectively , such as those with dementia , an increase in confusion or display of aggressive behaviors or agitation may signal that discomfort exists , and further assessment is necessary .

traditionally , the first step in most buddhist schools requires taking refuge in the three jewels ( sanskrit : tri-ratna , pāli : ti-ratana ) [ web 19 ] as the foundation of one 's religious practice . the practice of taking refuge on behalf of young or even unborn children is mentioned in the majjhima nikaya , recognized by most scholars as an early text ( cf . infant baptism ) . tibetan buddhism sometimes adds a fourth refuge , in the lama . in mahayana , the person who chooses the bodhisattva path makes a vow or pledge , considered the ultimate expression of compassion . in mahayana , too , the three jewels are perceived as possessed of an eternal and unchanging essence and as having an irreversible effect : " the three jewels have the quality of excellence . just as real jewels never change their faculty and goodness , whether praised or reviled , so are the three jewels ( refuges ) , because they have an eternal and immutable essence . these three jewels bring a fruition that is changeless , for once one has reached buddhahood , there is no possibility of falling back to suffering .
while west had encountered controversy a year prior when he stormed out of the american music awards of 2004 after losing best new artist , the rapper 's first large-scale controversy came just days following late registration 's release , during a benefit concert for hurricane katrina victims . in september 2005 , nbc broadcast a concert for hurricane relief , and west was a featured speaker . when west was presenting alongside actor mike myers , he deviated from the prepared script . myers spoke next and continued to read the script . once it was west 's turn to speak again , he said , " george bush does n't care about black people .

despite occasional theoretical diversity , the actual practice of translation has hardly changed since antiquity . except for some extreme metaphrasers in the early christian period and the middle ages , and adapters in various periods ( especially pre-classical rome , and the 18th century ) , translators have generally shown prudent flexibility in seeking equivalents — " literal " where possible , paraphrastic where necessary — for the original meaning and other crucial " values " ( e.g. , style , verse form , concordance with musical accompaniment or , in films , with speech articulatory movements ) as determined from context .

in the early stages of the first punic war ( 264 bc ) the first known roman gladiatorial munus was held , described as a funeral blood-rite to the manes of a roman military aristocrat . the gladiator munus was never explicitly acknowledged as a human sacrifice , probably because death was not its inevitable outcome or purpose . even so , the gladiators swore their lives to the infernal gods , and the combat was dedicated as an offering to the di manes or other gods . the event was therefore a sacrificium in the strict sense of the term , and christian writers later condemned it as human sacrifice .
the obama administration began to reengage in iraq with a series of airstrikes aimed at isis beginning on 10 august 2014 . on 9 september 2014 president obama said that he had the authority he needed to take action to destroy the militant group known as the islamic state of iraq and the levant , citing the 2001 authorization for use of military force against terrorists , and thus did not require additional approval from congress . the following day on 10 september 2014 president barack obama made a televised speech about isil , which he stated " our objective is clear : we will degrade , and ultimately destroy , isil through a comprehensive and sustained counter-terrorism strategy " . obama has authorized the deployment of additional u.s . forces into iraq , as well as authorizing direct military operations against isil within syria . on the night of 21/22 september the united states , saudi arabia , bahrain , the uae , jordan and qatar started air attacks against isis in syria .

by the late 80s , house had moved west , particularly to san francisco , oakland , los angeles , fresno , san diego and seattle . los angeles saw a huge explosion of underground raves and djs , notably djs marques wyatt and billy long , who spun at jewel 's catch one , the oldest dance club in america . in 1989 , the l.a. based , former ebn-ozn singer/rapper robert ozn started indie house label one voice records , releasing the mike " hitman " wilson remix of dada nada 's " haunted house , " which garnered instant club and mix show radio play in chicago , detroit and new york as well as in the u.k. and france . the record shot up to number five on the billboard club chart , marking it as the first house record by a white artist to chart in the u.s. dada nada , the moniker for ozn 's solo act , released in 1990 , what has become a classic example of jazz-based deep house , the frankie knuckles and david morales remix of dada nada 's " deep love " ( one voice records/us , polydor/uk ) , featuring ozn 's lush , crooning vocals and muted trumpet improvisational solos , underscoring deep house 's progression into a genre that integrated jazz and pop songwriting structures – a feature which continued to set it apart from acid house and techno .
devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years , mostly using one-to-one correspondence with fingers . the earliest counting device was probably a form of tally stick . later record keeping aids throughout the fertile crescent included calculi ( clay spheres , cones , etc . ) which represented counts of items , probably livestock or grains , sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers . the use of counting rods is one example .
many minerals provide pigments which have been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries . pigments , in this case , are minerals which reflect the color green , rather that emitting it through luminescent or phosphorescent qualities . the large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all . among the more notable green minerals , however is the emerald , which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium . chromium ( iii ) oxide ( cr2o3 ) , is called chrome green , also called viridian or institutional green when used as a pigment . for many years , the source of amazonite 's color was a mystery . widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors , the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar . copper is the source of the green color in malachite pigments , chemically known as basic copper ( ii ) carbonate .
in principle , comprehensive schools were conceived as " neighbourhood " schools for all students in a specified catchment area . current education reforms with academies programme , free schools and university technical colleges will no doubt have some impact on the comprehensive ideal but it is too early to say to what degree .

in the madonna companion biographers allen metz and carol benson noted that more than any other recent pop artist , madonna had used mtv and music videos to establish her popularity and enhance her recorded work . according to them , many of her songs have the imagery of the music video in strong context , while referring to the music . cultural critic mark c. taylor in his book nots ( 1993 ) felt that the postmodern art form par excellence is video and the reigning " queen of video " is madonna . he further asserted that " the most remarkable creation of mtv is madonna . the responses to madonna 's excessively provocative videos have been predictably contradictory . " the media and public reaction towards her most-discussed songs such as " papa do n't preach " , " like a prayer " , or " justify my love " had to do with the music videos created to promote the songs and their impact , rather than the songs themselves . morton felt that " artistically , madonna 's songwriting is often overshadowed by her striking pop videos . "
the new kievan state prospered due to its abundant supply of furs , beeswax , honey , and slaves for export , and because it controlled three main trade routes of eastern europe . in the north , novgorod served as a commercial link between the baltic sea and the volga trade route to the lands of the volga bulgars , the khazars , and across the caspian sea as far as baghdad , providing access to markets and products from central asia and the middle east . trade from the baltic also moved south on a network of rivers and short portages along the dnieper known as the " route from the varangians to the greeks , " continuing to the black sea and on to constantinople . kiev was a central outpost along the dnieper route and a hub with the east-west overland trade route between the khazars and the germanic lands of central europe . these commercial connections enriched rus ' merchants and princes , funding military forces and the construction of churches , palaces , fortifications , and further towns . demand for luxury goods fostered production of expensive jewelry and religious wares , allowing their export , and an advanced credit and money-lending system may have also been in place .
the council does not have executive powers but meets biannually to discuss issues of mutual importance . similarly , the parliamentary assembly has no legislative powers but investigates and collects witness evidence from the public on matters of mutual concern to its members . reports on its findings are presented to the governments of ireland and the united kingdom . during the february 2008 meeting of the british–irish council , it was agreed to set up a standing secretariat that would serve as a permanent 'civil service ' for the council . leading on from developments in the british–irish council , the chair of the british–irish inter-parliamentary assembly , niall blaney , has suggested that the body should shadow the british–irish council 's work .
furthermore , the amount of time adolescents spend on work and leisure activities varies greatly by culture as a result of cultural norms and expectations , as well as various socioeconomic factors . american teenagers spend less time in school or working and more time on leisure activities—which include playing sports , socializing , and caring for their appearance—than do adolescents in many other countries . these differences may be influenced by cultural values of education and the amount of responsibility adolescents are expected to assume in their family or community .

the swiss climate is generally temperate , but can vary greatly between the localities , from glacial conditions on the mountaintops to the often pleasant near mediterranean climate at switzerland 's southern tip . there are some valley areas in the southern part of switzerland where some cold-hardy palm trees are found . summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall so they are ideal for pastures and grazing . the less humid winters in the mountains may see long intervals of stable conditions for weeks , while the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion , during these periods , thus seeing no sun for weeks .
the softness of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity ( 59.6×106 s/m ) and thus also high thermal conductivity , which are the second highest ( to silver ) among pure metals at room temperature . this is because the resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature mostly originates from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice , which are relatively weak for a soft metal . the maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately 3.1×106 a/m2 of cross-sectional area , above which it begins to heat excessively . as with other metals , if copper is placed against another metal , galvanic corrosion will occur .
the evolution of the greek sculpture can be observed in his depictions from the almost static formal kouros type in early archaic period , to the representation of motion in a relative harmonious whole in late archaic period . in classical greece the emphasis is not given to the illusive imaginative reality represented by the ideal forms , but to the analogies and the interaction of the members in the whole , a method created by polykleitos . finally praxiteles seems to be released from any art and religious conformities , and his masterpieces are a mixture of naturalism with stylization .
under the royal assent act 1967 , royal assent can be granted by the sovereign in writing , by means of letters patent , that are presented to the presiding officer of each house of parliament . then , the presiding officer makes a formal , but simple statement to the house , acquainting each house that royal assent has been granted to the acts mentioned . thus , unlike the granting of royal assent by the monarch in person or by royal commissioners , the method created by the royal assent act 1967 does not require both houses to meet jointly for the purpose of receiving the notice of royal assent . the standard text of the letters patent is set out in the crown office ( forms and proclamations rules ) order 1992 , with minor amendments in 2000 . in practice this remains the standard method , a fact that is belied by the wording of the letters patent for the appointment of the royal commissioners and by the wording of the letters patent for the granting of royal assent in writing under the 1967 act ( " ... and forasmuch as we can not at this time be present in the higher house of our said parliament being the accustomed place for giving our royal assent ... " ) .
in 2003 the fa took the decision to permanently use the new wembley for semi-finals to recoup debts in financing the new stadium . this was controversial , with the move seen as both unfair to fans of teams located far from london , as well as taking some of the prestige away from a wembley final . in defending the move , the fa has also cited the extra capacity wembley offers , although the 2013 fixture between millwall and wigan led to the unprecedented step of placing 6,000 tickets on sale to neutral fans after the game failed to sell out . a fan poll by the guardian in 2013 found 86 % opposition to wembley semi-finals .
around 746 , abu muslim assumed leadership of the hashimiyya in khurasan . in 747 , he successfully initiated an open revolt against umayyad rule , which was carried out under the sign of the black flag . he soon established control of khurasan , expelling its umayyad governor , nasr ibn sayyar , and dispatched an army westwards . kufa fell to the hashimiyya in 749 , the last umayyad stronghold in iraq , wasit , was placed under siege , and in november of the same year abu al-abbas was recognized as the new caliph in the mosque at kufa . [ citation needed ] at this point marwan mobilized his troops from harran and advanced toward iraq . in january 750 the two forces met in the battle of the zab , and the umayyads were defeated . damascus fell to the abbasids in april , and in august , marwan was killed in egypt .
prior diego saw immediately one of the paramount reasons for the spread of the unorthodox movement : the representatives of the holy church acted and moved with an offensive amount of pomp and ceremony . on the other hand , the cathars lived in a state of self-sacrifice that was widely appealing . for these reasons , prior diego suggested that the papal legates begin to live a reformed apostolic life . the legates agreed to change if they could find a strong leader . the prior took up the challenge , and he and dominic dedicated themselves to the conversion of the albigensians . despite this particular mission , in winning the albigensians over by persuasion dominic met limited success , " for though in his ten years of preaching a large number of converts were made , it has to be said that the results were not such as had been hoped for . "
in germany , groups such as einstürzende neubauten developed a unique style of industrial music , utilizing avant-garde noise , homemade instruments and found objects . members of that group would later go on to collaborate with members of the birthday party . in brazil , the post-punk scene grew after the generation of brasilia rock with bands such as legião urbana , capital inicial and plebe rude and then the opening of the music club madame satã in são paulo , with acts like cabine c , titãs , patife band , fellini and mercenárias , as documented on compilations like the sexual life of the savages and the não wave/não são paulo series , released in the uk , germany and brazil , respectively .

apart from the united nations headquarters , the swiss confederation is host to many un agencies , like the world health organization ( who ) , the international labour organization ( ilo ) , the international telecommunication union ( itu ) , the united nations high commissioner for refugees ( unhcr ) and about 200 other international organisations , including the world trade organization and the world intellectual property organization . the annual meetings of the world economic forum in davos bring together top international business and political leaders from switzerland and foreign countries to discuss important issues facing the world , including health and the environment . additionally the headquarters of the bank for international settlements ( bis ) are located in basel since 1930 .
investitures , which include the conferring of knighthoods by dubbing with a sword , and other awards take place in the palace 's ballroom , built in 1854 . at 36.6 m ( 120 ft ) long , 18 m ( 59 ft ) wide and 13.5 m ( 44 ft ) high , it is the largest room in the palace . it has replaced the throne room in importance and use . during investitures , the queen stands on the throne dais beneath a giant , domed velvet canopy , known as a shamiana or a baldachin , that was used at the delhi durbar in 1911 . a military band plays in the musicians ' gallery as award recipients approach the queen and receive their honours , watched by their families and friends .
in other cities , class conflict was more evident . over a quarter of london 's population had left the city by november 1940 . civilians left for more remote areas of the country . upsurges in population south wales and gloucester intimated where these displaced people went . other reasons , including industry dispersal may have been a factor . however , resentment of rich self-evacuees or hostile treatment of poor ones were signs of persistence of class resentments although these factors did not appear to threaten social order . the total number of evacuees numbered 1.4 million , including a high proportion from the poorest inner-city families . reception committees were completely unprepared for the condition of some of the children . far from displaying the nation 's unity in time of war , the scheme backfired , often aggravating class antagonism and bolstering prejudice about the urban poor . within four months , 88 % of evacuated mothers , 86 % of small children , and 43 % of school children had been returned home . the lack of bombing in the phoney war contributed significantly to the return of people to the cities , but class conflict was not eased a year later when evacuation operations had to be put into effect again .
bermuda 's economy is based on offshore insurance and reinsurance , and tourism , the two largest economic sectors . bermuda had one of the world 's highest gdp per capita for most of the 20th century and several years beyond . recently , its economic status has been affected by the global recession . it has a subtropical climate . bermuda is the northernmost point of the bermuda triangle , a region of sea in which , according to legend , a number of aircraft and surface vessels have disappeared under supposedly unexplained or mysterious circumstances . the island is in the hurricane belt and prone to severe weather . however , it is somewhat protected from the full force of a hurricane by the coral reef that surrounds the island .
controversy erupted when madonna decided to adopt from malawi again . chifundo " mercy " james was finally adopted in june 2009 . madonna had known mercy from the time she went to adopt david . mercy 's grandmother had initially protested the adoption , but later gave in , saying " at first i did n't want her to go but as a family we had to sit down and reach an agreement and we agreed that mercy should go . the men insisted that mercy be adopted and i wo n't resist anymore . i still love mercy . she is my dearest . " mercy 's father was still adamant saying that he could not support the adoption since he was alive .
teenager sanjaya malakar was the season 's most talked-about contestant for his unusual hairdo , and for managing to survive elimination for many weeks due in part to the weblog vote for the worst and satellite radio personality howard stern , who both encouraged fans to vote for him . however , on april 18 , sanjaya was voted off .
human settlement of the new world occurred in stages from the bering sea coast line , with an initial 15,000 to 20,000-year layover on beringia for the small founding population . the micro-satellite diversity and distributions of the y lineage specific to south america indicates that certain indigenous peoples of the americas populations have been isolated since the initial colonization of the region . the na-dené , inuit and indigenous alaskan populations exhibit haplogroup q ( y-dna ) mutations , however are distinct from other indigenous peoples of the americas with various mtdna and atdna mutations . this suggests that the earliest migrants into the northern extremes of north america and greenland derived from later migrant populations .
gymnasts sprint down a runway , which is a maximum of 25 meters in length , before hurdling onto a spring board . the gymnast is allowed to choose where they start on the runway . the body position is maintained while " punching " ( blocking using only a shoulder movement ) the vaulting platform . the gymnast then rotates to a standing position . in advanced gymnastics , multiple twists and somersaults may be added before landing . successful vaults depend on the speed of the run , the length of the hurdle , the power the gymnast generates from the legs and shoulder girdle , the kinesthetic awareness in the air , and the speed of rotation in the case of more difficult and complex vaults .
many adaptations of the instrument have been done to cater to the special needs of indian carnatic music . in indian classical music and indian light music , the mandolin , which bears little resemblance to the european mandolin , is usually tuned e-b-e-b . as there is no concept of absolute pitch in indian classical music , any convenient tuning maintaining these relative pitch intervals between the strings can be used . another prevalent tuning with these intervals is c-g-c-g , which corresponds to sa-pa-sa-pa in the indian carnatic classical music style . this tuning corresponds to the way violins are tuned for carnatic classical music . this type of mandolin is also used in bhangra , dance music popular in punjabi culture .
the charaka samhita , thought to have been written between 300 and 500 ad , mentions a metal which , when oxidized , produces pushpanjan , thought to be zinc oxide . zinc mines at zawar , near udaipur in india , have been active since the mauryan period . the smelting of metallic zinc here , however , appears to have begun around the 12th century ad . one estimate is that this location produced an estimated million tonnes of metallic zinc and zinc oxide from the 12th to 16th centuries . another estimate gives a total production of 60,000 tonnes of metallic zinc over this period . the rasaratna samuccaya , written in approximately the 13th century ad , mentions two types of zinc-containing ores : one used for metal extraction and another used for medicinal purposes .
after fans noticed mercury 's increasingly gaunt appearance in 1988 , rumours began to spread that mercury was suffering from aids . mercury flatly denied this , insisting he was merely " exhausted " and too busy to provide interviews . the band decided to continue making albums , starting with the miracle in 1989 and continuing with innuendo in 1991 . despite his deteriorating health , the lead singer continued to contribute . for the last two albums made while mercury was still alive , the band credited all songs to queen , rather than specific members of the group , freeing them of internal conflict and differences . in 1990 , queen ended their contract with capitol and signed with disney 's hollywood records , which has since remained the group 's music catalogue owner in the united states and canada . that same year , mercury made his final public appearance when he joined the rest of queen to collect the brit award for outstanding contribution to british music .
medievalist specialists who define the university as a legally autonomous corporation disagree with the term " university " for the islamic madaris and jāmi ‘ ahs because the medieval university ( from latin universitas ) was structurally different , being a legally autonomous corporation rather than a waqf institution like the madrasa and jāmiʻah . despite the many similarities , medieval specialists have coined the term " islamic college " for madrasa and jāmiʻah to differentiate them from the legally autonomous corporations that the medieval european universities were . in a sense , the madrasa resembles a university college in that it has most of the features of a university , but lacks the corporate element . toby huff summarises the difference as follows :
as sun-god and god of light , apollo was also known by the epithets aegletes ( /əˈɡliːtiːz/ ə-glee-teez ; αἰγλήτης , aiglētēs , from αἴγλη , " light of the sun " ) , helius ( /ˈhiːliəs/ hee-lee-əs ; ἥλιος , helios , literally " sun " ) , phanaeus ( /fəˈniːəs/ fə-nee-əs ; φαναῖος , phanaios , literally " giving or bringing light " ) , and lyceus ( /laɪˈsiːəs/ ly-see-əs ; λύκειος , lykeios , from proto-greek *λύκη , " light " ) . the meaning of the epithet " lyceus " later became associated with apollo 's mother leto , who was the patron goddess of lycia ( λυκία ) and who was identified with the wolf ( λύκος ) , earning him the epithets lycegenes ( /laɪˈsɛdʒəniːz/ ly-sej-ə-neez ; λυκηγενής , lukēgenēs , literally " born of a wolf " or " born of lycia " ) and lycoctonus ( /laɪˈkɒktənəs/ ly-kok-tə-nəs ; λυκοκτόνος , lykoktonos , from λύκος , " wolf " , and κτείνειν , " to kill " ) . as god of the sun , apollo was called sol ( /ˈsɒl/ sol , literally " sun " in latin ) by the romans .
most common glass contains other ingredients to change its properties . lead glass or flint glass is more 'brilliant ' because the increased refractive index causes noticeably more specular reflection and increased optical dispersion . adding barium also increases the refractive index . thorium oxide gives glass a high refractive index and low dispersion and was formerly used in producing high-quality lenses , but due to its radioactivity has been replaced by lanthanum oxide in modern eyeglasses . [ citation needed ] iron can be incorporated into glass to absorb infrared energy , for example in heat absorbing filters for movie projectors , while cerium ( iv ) oxide can be used for glass that absorbs uv wavelengths .
there are many innovative art galleries in the city . the southampton city art gallery at the civic centre is one of the best known and as well as a nationally important designated collection , houses several permanent and travelling exhibitions . the millais gallery at southampton solent university , the john hansard gallery at southampton university as well as smaller galleries including the art house in above bar street provide a different view . the city 's bargate is also an art gallery run by the arts organisation " a space " . a space also run the art vaults project , which creatively uses several of southampton 's medieval vaults , halls and cellars as venues for contemporary art installations .

the university employs 3,401 full-time faculty members across its eleven schools , including 18 members of the national academy of sciences , 65 members of the american academy of arts and sciences , 19 members of the national academy of engineering , and 6 members of the institute of medicine . notable faculty include 2010 nobel prize–winning economist dale t. mortensen ; nano-scientist chad mirkin ; tony award-winning director mary zimmerman ; management expert philip kotler ; king faisal international prize in science recipient sir fraser stoddart ; steppenwolf theatre director anna shapiro ; sexual psychologist j. michael bailey ; holocaust denier arthur butz ; federalist society co-founder steven calabresi ; former weatherman bernardine rae dohrn ; ethnographer gary alan fine ; pulitzer prize–winning historian garry wills ; american academy of arts and sciences fellow monica olvera de la cruz and macarthur fellowship recipients stuart dybek , and jennifer richeson . notable former faculty include political advisor david axelrod , artist ed paschke , writer charles newman , nobel prize–winning chemist john pople , and military sociologist and " do n't ask , do n't tell " author charles moskos .
in the final days of world war ii in yugoslavia , units of the partisans were responsible for atrocities after the repatriations of bleiburg , and accusations of culpability were later raised at the yugoslav leadership under tito . at the time , josip broz tito repeatedly issued calls for surrender to the retreating column , offering amnesty and attempting to avoid a disorderly surrender . on 14 may he dispatched a telegram to the supreme headquarters slovene partisan army prohibiting " in the sternest language " the execution of prisoners of war and commanding the transfer of the possible suspects to a military court .
in 2012 , fortune ranked ibm the second largest u.s. firm in terms of number of employees ( 435,000 worldwide ) , the fourth largest in terms of market capitalization , the ninth most profitable , and the nineteenth largest firm in terms of revenue . globally , the company was ranked the 31st largest in terms of revenue by forbes for 2011 . other rankings for 2011/2012 include №1 company for leaders ( fortune ) , №1 green company in the united states ( newsweek ) , №2 best global brand ( interbrand ) , №2 most respected company ( barron 's ) , №5 most admired company ( fortune ) , and №18 most innovative company ( fast company ) .
mary is also depicted as being present among the women at the crucifixion during the crucifixion standing near " the disciple whom jesus loved " along with mary of clopas and mary magdalene , [ jn 19:25-26 ] to which list matthew 27:56 adds " the mother of the sons of zebedee " , presumably the salome mentioned in mark 15:40 . this representation is called a stabat mater . while not recorded in the gospel accounts , mary cradling the dead body of her son is a common motif in art , called a " pietà " or " pity " .
the other directly attested old iranian dialects are the two forms of avestan , which take their name from their use in the avesta , the liturgical texts of indigenous iranian religion that now goes by the name of zoroastrianism but in the avesta itself is simply known as vohu daena ( later : behdin ) . the language of the avesta is subdivided into two dialects , conventionally known as " old ( or 'gathic ' ) avestan " , and " younger avestan " . these terms , which date to the 19th century , are slightly misleading since 'younger avestan ' is not only much younger than 'old avestan ' , but also from a different geographic region . the old avestan dialect is very archaic , and at roughly the same stage of development as rigvedic sanskrit . on the other hand , younger avestan is at about the same linguistic stage as old persian , but by virtue of its use as a sacred language retained its " old " characteristics long after the old iranian languages had yielded to their middle iranian stage . unlike old persian , which has middle persian as its known successor , avestan has no clearly identifiable middle iranian stage ( the effect of middle iranian is indistinguishable from effects due to other causes ) .
international observers of council of europe and us department of state have questioned the fairness of armenia 's parliamentary and presidential elections and constitutional referendum since 1995 , citing polling deficiencies , lack of cooperation by the electoral commission , and poor maintenance of electoral lists and polling places . freedom house categorized armenia in its 2008 report as a " semi-consolidated authoritarian regime " ( along with moldova , kosovo , kyrgyzstan , and russia ) and ranked armenia 20th among 29 nations in transition , with a democracy score of 5.21 out of 7 ( 7 represents the lowest democratic progress ) .
following the events in olympia , there were reports that china requested permission to deploy people 's liberation army personnel along the relay route to protect the flame in canberra . australian authorities stated that such a request , if it were to be made , would be refused . chinese officials labeled it a rumor . australian police have been given powers to search relay spectators , following a call by the chinese students and scholars association for chinese australian students to " go defend our sacred torch " against " ethnic degenerate scum and anti-china separatists " . tony goh , chairman of the australian council of chinese organisations , has said the acco would be taking " thousands " of pro-beijing demonstrators to canberra by bus , to support the torch relay . zhang rongan , a chinese australian student organising pro-beijing demonstrations , told the press that chinese diplomats were assisting with the organization of buses , meals and accommodation for pro-beijing demonstrators , and helping them organise a " peaceful show of strength " . foreign minister stephen smith said chinese officials were urging supporters to " turn up and put a point of view " , but that he had no objection to it as long as they remained peaceful .
elsewhere in the americas , in the caribbean in particular , baptist missionaries took an active role in the anti-slavery movement . in jamaica , for example , william knibb , a prominent british baptist missionary , worked toward the emancipation of slaves in the british west indies ( which took place in 1838 ) . knibb also protagonised the creation of " free villages " ; rural communities centred around a baptist church where emancipated slaves could farm their own land . baptists were likewise active in promoting the education of former slaves ; for example , jamaica 's calabar high school , named after the slave port of calabar , was formed by baptist missionaries . at the same time , during and after slavery , slaves and free formed their own spiritual baptist movements - breakaway spiritual movements which often expressed resistance to oppression .
the four main dialectal forms of old english were mercian , northumbrian , kentish , and west saxon . mercian and northumbrian are together referred to as anglian . in terms of geography the northumbrian region lay north of the humber river ; the mercian lay north of the thames and south of the humber river ; west saxon lay south and southwest of the thames ; and the smallest , kentish region lay southeast of the thames , a small corner of england . the kentish region , settled by the jutes from jutland , has the scantiest literary remains .
commentaries dealing with the zahir ( outward aspects ) of the text are called tafsir , and hermeneutic and esoteric commentaries dealing with the batin are called ta'wil ( " interpretation " or " explanation " ) , which involves taking the text back to its beginning . commentators with an esoteric slant believe that the ultimate meaning of the quran is known only to god . in contrast , quranic literalism , followed by salafis and zahiris , is the belief that the quran should only be taken at its apparent meaning .

in central portions of the u.s. , tornadoes are more common than anywhere else on earth and touch down most commonly in the spring and summer . deadly and destructive hurricanes occur almost every year along the atlantic seaboard and the gulf of mexico . the appalachian region and the midwest experience the worst floods , though virtually no area in the u.s. is immune to flooding . the southwest has the worst droughts ; one is thought to have lasted over 500 years and to have hurt ancestral pueblo peoples . the west is affected by large wildfires each year .
although the reformation was a religious movement , it also had a strong impact on all other aspects of life : marriage and family , education , the humanities and sciences , the political and social order , the economy , and the arts . protestant churches reject the idea of a celibate priesthood and thus allow their clergy to marry . many of their families contributed to the development of intellectual elites in their countries . since about 1950 , women have entered the ministry , and some have assumed leading positions ( e.g . bishops ) , in most protestant churches .
the nea moni monastery on chios was established by constantine monomachos in 1043–1056 . the exceptional mosaic decoration of the dome showing probably the nine orders of the angels was destroyed in 1822 but other panels survived ( theotokos with raised hands , four evangelists with seraphim , scenes from christ 's life and an interesting anastasis where king salomon bears resemblance to constantine monomachos ) . in comparison with osios loukas nea moni mosaics contain more figures , detail , landscape and setting .
until 18 december 2010 , eton college was an exempt charity under english law ( charities act 1993 , schedule 2 ) . under the provisions of the charities act 2006 , it is now an excepted charity , and fully registered with the charities commission , and is now one of the 100 largest charities in the uk . as a charity , it benefits from substantial tax breaks . it was calculated by the late david jewell , former master of haileybury , that in 1992 such tax breaks saved the school about £1,945 per pupil per year , although he had no direct connection with the school . this subsidy has declined since the 2001 abolition by the labour government of state-funded scholarships ( formerly known as " assisted places " ) to independent schools . however , no child attended eton on this scheme , meaning that the actual level of state assistance to the school has always been lower . eton 's retiring head master , tony little , has claimed that the benefits that eton provides to the local community free of charge ( use of its facilities , etc . ) have a higher value than the tax breaks it receives as a result of its charitable status . the fee for the academic year 2010–2011 was £29,862 ( approximately us $ 48,600 or €35,100 as of march 2011 ) , although the sum is considerably lower for those pupils on bursaries and scholarships .
no single feature distinguishes annelids from other invertebrate phyla , but they have a distinctive combination of features . their bodies are long , with segments that are divided externally by shallow ring-like constrictions called annuli and internally by septa ( " partitions " ) at the same points , although in some species the septa are incomplete and in a few cases missing . most of the segments contain the same sets of organs , although sharing a common gut , circulatory system and nervous system makes them inter-dependent . their bodies are covered by a cuticle ( outer covering ) that does not contain cells but is secreted by cells in the skin underneath , is made of tough but flexible collagen and does not molt – on the other hand arthropods ' cuticles are made of the more rigid α-chitin , and molt until the arthropods reach their full size . most annelids have closed circulatory systems , where the blood makes its entire circuit via blood vessels .
the ultimate substantive legacy of principia mathematica is mixed . it is generally accepted that kurt gödel 's incompleteness theorem of 1931 definitively demonstrated that for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics , there would in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them , and hence that principia mathematica could never achieve its aims . however , gödel could not have come to this conclusion without whitehead and russell 's book . in this way , principia mathematica 's legacy might be described as its key role in disproving the possibility of achieving its own stated goals . but beyond this somewhat ironic legacy , the book popularized modern mathematical logic and drew important connections between logic , epistemology , and metaphysics .
in his 1884 article william james argued that feelings and emotions were secondary to physiological phenomena . in his theory , james proposed that the perception of what he called an " exciting fact " directly led to a physiological response , known as " emotion . " to account for different types of emotional experiences , james proposed that stimuli trigger activity in the autonomic nervous system , which in turn produces an emotional experience in the brain . the danish psychologist carl lange also proposed a similar theory at around the same time , and therefore this theory became known as the james–lange theory . as james wrote , " the perception of bodily changes , as they occur , is the emotion . " james further claims that " we feel sad because we cry , angry because we strike , afraid because we tremble , and neither we cry , strike , nor tremble because we are sorry , angry , or fearful , as the case may be . "
in the united states , federalism originally referred to belief in a stronger central government . when the u.s. constitution was being drafted , the federalist party supported a stronger central government , while " anti-federalists " wanted a weaker central government . this is very different from the modern usage of " federalism " in europe and the united states . the distinction stems from the fact that " federalism " is situated in the middle of the political spectrum between a confederacy and a unitary state . the u.s. constitution was written as a reaction to the articles of confederation , under which the united states was a loose confederation with a weak central government .
while the ming dynasty traded horses with tibet , it upheld a policy of outlawing border markets in the north , which laird sees as an effort to punish the mongols for their raids and to " drive them from the frontiers of china . " however , after altan khan ( 1507–1582 ) —leader of the tümed mongols who overthrew the oirat mongol confederation 's hegemony over the steppes—made peace with the ming dynasty in 1571 , he persuaded the ming to reopen their border markets in 1573 . this provided the chinese with a new supply of horses that the mongols had in excess ; it was also a relief to the ming , since they were unable to stop the mongols from periodic raiding . laird says that despite the fact that later mongols believed altan forced the ming to view him as an equal , chinese historians argue that he was simply a loyal chinese citizen . by 1578 , altan khan formed a formidable mongol-tibetan alliance with the gelug that the ming viewed from afar without intervention .
schwarzenegger wanted to move from bodybuilding into acting , finally achieving it when he was chosen to play the role of hercules in 1970 's hercules in new york . credited under the name " arnold strong , " his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production . his second film appearance was as a deaf mute hit-man for the mob in director robert altman 's the long goodbye ( 1973 ) , which was followed by a much more significant part in the film stay hungry ( 1976 ) , for which he was awarded a golden globe for new male star of the year . schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career . " it was very difficult for me in the beginning – i was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird ' , that i had a funny accent , and that my name was too long . you name it , and they told me i had to change it . basically , everywhere i turned , i was told that i had no chance . "
somali cuisine varies from region to region and consists of a fusion of diverse culinary influences . it is the product of somalia 's rich tradition of trade and commerce . despite the variety , there remains one thing that unites the various regional cuisines : all food is served halal . there are therefore no pork dishes , alcohol is not served , nothing that died on its own is eaten , and no blood is incorporated .
as of 2006 , the ipod was produced by about 14,000 workers in the u.s. and 27,000 overseas . further , the salaries attributed to this product were overwhelmingly distributed to highly skilled u.s. professionals , as opposed to lower skilled u.s. retail employees or overseas manufacturing labor . one interpretation of this result is that u.s. innovation can create more jobs overseas than domestically .
the power of parliament to pass bills was often thwarted by monarchs . charles i dissolved parliament in 1629 , after it passed motions critical of and bills seeking to restrict his arbitrary exercise of power . during the eleven years of personal rule that followed , charles performed legally dubious actions , such as raising taxes without parliament 's approval . after the english civil war , it was accepted that parliament should be summoned to meet regularly , but it was still commonplace for monarchs to refuse royal assent to bills . in 1678 , charles ii withheld his assent from a bill " for preserving the peace of the kingdom by raising the militia , and continuing them in duty for two and forty days , " suggesting that he , not parliament , should control the militia . the last stuart monarch , anne , similarly withheld on 11 march 1708 , on the advice of her ministers , her assent from a bill for the settling of militia in scotland . no monarch has since withheld royal assent on a bill passed by the british parliament .
during the cantonal revolution of 1873 , a cantonalist uprising that took place during the first spanish republic , the city was consolidated with most of the nearby cities in the federal canton of valencia ( proclaimed on 19 july and dissolved on 7 august ) . it did not have the revolutionary fervor of the movement in cities like alcoy , as it was initiated by the bourgeoisie , but the madrid government sent general martinez-campos to stifle the rebellion by force of arms and subjected valencia to an intense bombardment . the city surrendered on 7 august ; alfonso xii was proclaimed king on 29 december 1874 , and arrived in valencia on 11 january 1875 on his way to madrid , marking the end of the first republic . despite the bourbon restoration , the roughly even balance between conservatives and liberals in the government was sustained in valencia until the granting of universal male suffrage in 1890 , after which the republicans , led by vicente blasco ibáñez , gained considerably more of the popular vote .
an important creation myth of the islands of tuvalu is the story of the te pusi mo te ali ( the eel and the flounder ) who created the islands of tuvalu ; te ali ( the flounder ) is believed to be the origin of the flat atolls of tuvalu and the te pusin ( the eel ) is the model for the coconut palms that are important in the lives of tuvaluans . the stories as to the ancestors of the tuvaluans vary from island to island . on niutao , funafuti and vaitupu the founding ancestor is described as being from samoa ; whereas on nanumea the founding ancestor is described as being from tonga .
according to genius , the james gleick-authored biography , feynman tried lsd during his professorship at caltech . somewhat embarrassed by his actions , he largely sidestepped the issue when dictating his anecdotes ; he mentions it in passing in the " o americano , outra vez " section , while the " altered states " chapter in surely you 're joking , mr. feynman ! describes only marijuana and ketamine experiences at john lilly 's famed sensory deprivation tanks , as a way of studying consciousness . feynman gave up alcohol when he began to show vague , early signs of alcoholism , as he did not want to do anything that could damage his brain—the same reason given in " o americano , outra vez " for his reluctance to experiment with lsd .
the city is also a leading center of popular culture and music . there are a multitude of venues hosting spanish and foreign-language performers . these include the 10,000-seat national auditorium that regularly schedules the spanish and english-language pop and rock artists , as well as many of the world 's leading performing arts ensembles , the auditorium also broadcasts grand opera performances from new york 's metropolitan opera on giant , high definition screens . in 2007 national auditorium was selected world 's best venue by multiple genre media .
with the onset of the crusades in 1095 , and the expulsions from england ( 1290 ) , france ( 1394 ) , and parts of germany ( 15th century ) , jewish migration pushed eastward into poland ( 10th century ) , lithuania ( 10th century ) , and russia ( 12th century ) . over this period of several hundred years , some have suggested , jewish economic activity was focused on trade , business management , and financial services , due to several presumed factors : christian european prohibitions restricting certain activities by jews , preventing certain financial activities ( such as " usurious " loans ) between christians , high rates of literacy , near universal male education , and ability of merchants to rely upon and trust family members living in different regions and countries .
in the mexico city airport , the government engaged in an extensive restructuring program that includes the addition of a new second terminal , which began operations in 2007 , and the enlargement of four other airports ( at the nearby cities of toluca , querétaro , puebla and cuernavaca ) that , along with mexico city 's airport , comprise the grupo aeroportuario del valle de méxico , distributing traffic to different regions in mexico . the city of pachuca will also provide additional expansion to central mexico 's airport network . mexico city 's airport is the main hub for 11 of the 21 national airline companies .
the mosaic pavement of the vrina plain basilica of butrint , albania appear to pre-date that of the baptistery by almost a generation , dating to the last quarter of the 5th or the first years of the 6th century . the mosaic displays a variety of motifs including sea-creatures , birds , terrestrial beasts , fruits , flowers , trees and abstracts – designed to depict a terrestrial paradise of god ’ s creation . superimposed on this scheme are two large tablets , tabulae ansatae , carrying inscriptions . a variety of fish , a crab , a lobster , shrimps , mushrooms , flowers , a stag and two cruciform designs surround the smaller of the two inscriptions , which reads : in fulfilment of the vow ( prayer ) of those whose names god knows . this anonymous dedicatory inscription is a public demonstration of the benefactors ’ humility and an acknowledgement of god ’ s omniscience .
malaysia-based yazhou zhoukan conducted an interview with former researcher at the china seismological bureau geng qingguo ( 耿庆国 ) , in which geng claimed that a confidential written report was sent to the state seismological bureau on april 30 , 2008 , warning about the possible occurrence of a significant earthquake in ngawa prefecture region of sichuan around may 8 , with a range of 10 days before or after the quake . geng , while acknowledging that earthquake prediction was broadly considered problematic by the scientific community , believed that " the bigger the earthquake , the easier it is to predict . " geng had long attempted to establish a correlation between the occurrence of droughts and earthquakes ; premier zhou enlai reportedly took an interest in geng 's work . geng 's drought-earthquake correlation theory was first released in 1972 , and said to have successfully predicted the 1975 haicheng and 1976 tangshan earthquakes . the same yazhou zhoukan article pointed out the inherent difficulties associated with predicting earthquakes . in response , an official with the seismological bureau stated that " earthquake prediction is widely acknowledged around the world to be difficult from a scientific standpoint . " the official also denied that the seismological bureau had received reports predicting the earthquake .
the insect outer skeleton , the cuticle , is made up of two layers : the epicuticle , which is a thin and waxy water resistant outer layer and contains no chitin , and a lower layer called the procuticle . the procuticle is chitinous and much thicker than the epicuticle and has two layers : an outer layer known as the exocuticle and an inner layer known as the endocuticle . the tough and flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous chitin and proteins , criss-crossing each other in a sandwich pattern , while the exocuticle is rigid and hardened . :22–24 the exocuticle is greatly reduced in many soft-bodied insects ( e.g. , caterpillars ) , especially during their larval stages .
in the first post war years tito was widely considered a communist leader very loyal to moscow , indeed , he was often viewed as second only to stalin in the eastern bloc . in fact , stalin and tito had an uneasy alliance from the start , with stalin considering tito too independent .
in the 20th century , russian was mandatorily taught in the schools of the members of the old warsaw pact and in other countries that used to be satellites of the ussr . in particular , these countries include poland , bulgaria , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , albania , former east germany and cuba . however , younger generations are usually not fluent in it , because russian is no longer mandatory in the school system . according to the eurobarometer 2005 survey , though , fluency in russian remains fairly high ( 20–40 % ) in some countries , in particular those where the people speak a slavic language and thereby have an edge in learning russian ( namely , poland , czech republic , slovakia , and bulgaria ) .
britain was concerned about russian activity and sir john burgoyne senior advisor to lord aberdeen urged that the dardanelles should be occupied and throw up works of sufficient strength to block any russian move to capture constantinople and gain access to the mediterranean sea . the corps of royal engineers sent men to the dardanelles while burgoyne went to paris , meeting the british ambassador and the french emperor . the lord cowley wrote on 8 february to burgoyne " your visit to paris has produced a visible change in the emperor 's views , and he is making every preparation for a land expedition in case the last attempt at negotiation should break down .

" hellenistic " is a modern word and a 19th-century concept ; the idea of a hellenistic period did not exist in ancient greece . although words related in form or meaning , e.g . hellenist ( ancient greek : ἑλληνιστής , hellēnistēs ) , have been attested since ancient times , it was j. g. droysen in the mid-19th century , who in his classic work geschichte des hellenismus , i.e . history of hellenism , coined the term hellenistic to refer to and define the period when greek culture spread in the non-greek world after alexander ’ s conquest . following droysen , hellenistic and related terms , e.g . hellenism , have been widely used in various contexts ; a notable such use is in culture and anarchy by matthew arnold , where hellenism is used in contrast with hebraism .
selfridges was established in 1909 by american-born harry gordon selfridge on oxford street . the company 's innovative marketing promoted the radical notion of shopping for pleasure rather than necessity and its techniques were adopted by modern department stores the world over . the store was extensively promoted through paid advertising . the shop floors were structured so that goods could be made more accessible to customers . there were elegant restaurants with modest prices , a library , reading and writing rooms , special reception rooms for french , german , american and " colonial " customers , a first aid room , and a silence room , with soft lights , deep chairs , and double-glazing , all intended to keep customers in the store as long as possible . staff members were taught to be on hand to assist customers , but not too aggressively , and to sell the merchandise . selfridge attracted shoppers with educational and scientific exhibits ; – in 1909 , louis blériot 's monoplane was exhibited at selfridges ( blériot was the first to fly over the english channel ) , and the first public demonstration of television by john logie baird took place in the department store in 1925 .
the suez crisis very publicly exposed britain 's limitations to the world and confirmed britain 's decline on the world stage , demonstrating that henceforth it could no longer act without at least the acquiescence , if not the full support , of the united states . the events at suez wounded british national pride , leading one mp to describe it as " britain 's waterloo " and another to suggest that the country had become an " american satellite " . margaret thatcher later described the mindset she believed had befallen the british political establishment as " suez syndrome " , from which britain did not recover until the successful recapture of the falkland islands from argentina in 1982 .
eritrea can be split into three ecoregions . to the east of the highlands are the hot , arid coastal plains stretching down to the southeast of the country . the cooler , more fertile highlands , reaching up to 3000m has a different habitat . habitats here vary from the sub-tropical rainforest at filfil solomona to the precipitous cliffs and canyons of the southern highlands . the afar triangle or danakil depression of eritrea is the probable location of a triple junction where three tectonic plates are pulling away from one another.the highest point of the country , emba soira , is located in the center of eritrea , at 3,018 meters ( 9,902 ft ) above sea level .
by april and may 1941 , the luftwaffe was still getting through to their targets , taking no more than one- to two-percent losses on any given mission . on 19/20 april 1941 , in honour of hitler 's 52nd birthday , 712 bombers hit plymouth with a record 1,000 tons of bombs . losses were minimal . in the following month , 22 german bombers were lost with 13 confirmed to have been shot down by night fighters . on 3/4 may , nine were shot down in one night . on 10/11 may , london suffered severe damage , but 10 german bombers were downed . in may 1941 , raf night fighters shot down 38 german bombers .
coyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs . leopards in particular are known to have a predilection for dogs , and have been recorded to kill and consume them regardless of the dog 's size or ferocity . tigers in manchuria , indochina , indonesia , and malaysia are reputed to kill dogs with the same vigor as leopards . striped hyenas are major predators of village dogs in turkmenistan , india , and the caucasus . reptiles such as alligators and pythons have been known to kill and eat dogs .
a commandery consisted of a group of counties , and was headed by an administrator . he was the top civil and military leader of the commandery and handled defense , lawsuits , seasonal instructions to farmers and recommendations of nominees for office sent annually to the capital in a quota system first established by emperor wu . the head of a large county of about 10,000 households was called a prefect , while the heads of smaller counties were called chiefs , and both could be referred to as magistrates . a magistrate maintained law and order in his county , registered the populace for taxation , mobilized commoners for annual corvée duties , repaired schools and supervised public works .
utrecht is well-connected to the dutch road network . two of the most important major roads serve the city of utrecht : the a12 and a2 motorways connect amsterdam , arnhem , the hague and maastricht , as well as belgium and germany . other major motorways in the area are the almere–breda a27 and the utrecht–groningen a28 . due to the increasing traffic and the ancient city plan , traffic congestion is a common phenomenon in and around utrecht , causing elevated levels of air pollutants . this has led to a passionate debate in the city about the best way to improve the city 's air quality .
moisture absorption occurs when the material is exposed to high humidity or water . both the resin and the reinforcement may absorb water ; water may be also soaked by capillary forces through voids in the materials and along the reinforcement . epoxies of the fr-4 materials are n't too susceptible , with absorption of only 0.15 % . teflon has very low absorption of 0.01 % . polyimides and cyanate esters , on the other side , suffer from high water absorption . absorbed water can lead to significant degradation of key parameters ; it impairs tracking resistance , breakdown voltage , and dielectric parameters . relative dielectric constant of water is about 73 , compared to about 4 for common circuitboard materials . absorbed moisture can also vaporize on heating and cause cracking and delamination , the same effect responsible for " popcorning " damage on wet packaging of electronic parts . careful baking of the substrates may be required .
the annelids are bilaterally symmetrical , triploblastic , coelomate , invertebrate organisms . they also have parapodia for locomotion . most textbooks still use the traditional division into polychaetes ( almost all marine ) , oligochaetes ( which include earthworms ) and leech-like species . cladistic research since 1997 has radically changed this scheme , viewing leeches as a sub-group of oligochaetes and oligochaetes as a sub-group of polychaetes . in addition , the pogonophora , echiura and sipuncula , previously regarded as separate phyla , are now regarded as sub-groups of polychaetes . annelids are considered members of the lophotrochozoa , a " super-phylum " of protostomes that also includes molluscs , brachiopods , flatworms and nemerteans .
the modern standard chinese exonym for the ethnic tibetan region is zangqu ( chinese : 藏区 ; pinyin : zàngqū ) , which derives by metonymy from the tsang region around shigatse plus the addition of a chinese suffix , 区 qū , which means " area , district , region , ward " . tibetan people , language , and culture , regardless of where they are from , are referred to as zang ( chinese : 藏 ; pinyin : zàng ) although the geographical term xīzàng is often limited to the tibet autonomous region . the term xīzàng was coined during the qing dynasty in the reign of the jiaqing emperor ( 1796–1820 ) through the addition of a prefix meaning " west " ( 西 xī ) to zang .
smaller boats and ships typically have machine-guns or fast cannons , which can often be deadly to low-flying aircraft if linked to a radar-directed fire-control system radar-controlled cannon for point defence . some vessels like aegis cruisers are as much a threat to aircraft as any land-based air defence system . in general , naval vessels should be treated with respect by aircraft , however the reverse is equally true . carrier battle groups are especially well defended , as not only do they typically consist of many vessels with heavy air defence armament but they are also able to launch fighter jets for combat air patrol overhead to intercept incoming airborne threats .
a dense wave of smog began in the central and eastern part of china on 2 december 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 kilometres ( 750 mi ) , including tianjin , hebei , shandong , jiangsu , anhui , shanghai and zhejiang . a lack of cold air flow , combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions , collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region . the heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern jiangsu province , especially in and around nanjing , with its aqi pollution index at " severely polluted " for five straight days and " heavily polluted " for nine . on 3 december 2013 , levels of pm2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic metre , falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic metre on 4 december 2013 . between 3:00 pm , 3 december and 2:00pm , 4 december local time , several expressways from nanjing to other jiangsu cities were closed , stranding dozens of passenger buses in zhongyangmen bus station . from 5 to 6 december , nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and closed down all kindergarten through middle schools . children 's hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent ; general incidence of bronchitis , pneumonia , upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased . the smog dissipated 12 december . officials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind , automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure , and coal-powered district heating system in north china region . prevailing winds blew low-hanging air masses of factory emissions ( mostly so2 ) towards china 's east coast .
sparta remained independent , but it was no longer the leading military power in the peloponnese . the spartan king cleomenes iii ( 235–222 bce ) staged a military coup against the conservative ephors and pushed through radical social and land reforms in order to increase the size of the shrinking spartan citizenry able to provide military service and restore spartan power . sparta 's bid for supremacy was crushed at the battle of sellasia ( 222 ) by the achaean league and macedon , who restored the power of the ephors .
the law of the united states comprises many levels of codified and uncodified forms of law , of which the most important is the united states constitution , the foundation of the federal government of the united states . the constitution sets out the boundaries of federal law , which consists of acts of congress , treaties ratified by the senate , regulations promulgated by the executive branch , and case law originating from the federal judiciary . the united states code is the official compilation and codification of general and permanent federal statutory law .
public buildings generally varied between the extremes of plain boxes with grid windows and italian late renaissance palaces , depending on budget . somerset house in london , designed by sir william chambers in 1776 for government offices , was as magnificent as any country house , though never quite finished , as funds ran out . barracks and other less prestigious buildings could be as functional as the mills and factories that were growing increasingly large by the end of the period . but as the period came to an end many commercial projects were becoming sufficiently large , and well-funded , to become " architectural in intention " , rather than having their design left to the lesser class of " surveyors " .
humans have shown extreme inventiveness in devising clothing solutions to environmental hazards . examples include : space suits , air conditioned clothing , armor , diving suits , swimsuits , bee-keeper gear , motorcycle leathers , high-visibility clothing , and other pieces of protective clothing . meanwhile , the distinction between clothing and protective equipment is not always clear-cut—since clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective value and clothes designed for function often consider fashion in their design . wearing clothes also has social implications . they cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered , act as a form of adornment , and serve other social purposes .
objections to banning the use of incandescent light bulbs include the higher initial cost of alternatives and lower quality of light of fluorescent lamps . some people have concerns about the health effects of fluorescent lamps . however , even though they contain mercury , the environmental performance of cfls is much better than that of light bulbs , mostly because they consume much less energy and therefore strongly reduce the environmental impact of power production . led lamps are even more efficient , and are free of mercury . they are regarded as the best solution in terms of cost effectiveness and robustness .
the queen surpassed her great-great-grandmother , queen victoria , to become the longest-lived british monarch in december 2007 , and the longest-reigning british monarch on 9 september 2015 . she was celebrated in canada as the " longest-reigning sovereign in canada 's modern era " . ( king louis xiv of france reigned over part of canada for longer . ) she is the longest-reigning queen regnant in history , the world 's oldest reigning monarch and second-longest-serving current head of state after king bhumibol adulyadej of thailand .
the detroit free press and the detroit news are the major daily newspapers , both broadsheet publications published together under a joint operating agreement called the detroit newspaper partnership . media philanthropy includes the detroit free press high school journalism program and the old newsboys ' goodfellow fund of detroit . in march 2009 , the two newspapers reduced home delivery to three days a week , print reduced newsstand issues of the papers on non-delivery days and focus resources on internet-based news delivery . the metro times , founded in 1980 , is a weekly publication , covering news , arts & entertainment .
the diwan of umar , assigning annuities to all arabs and to the muslim soldiers of other races , underwent a change in the hands of the umayyads . the umayyads meddled with the register and the recipients regarded pensions as the subsistence allowance even without being in active service . hisham reformed it and paid only to those who participated in battle . on the pattern of the byzantine system the umayyads reformed their army organization in general and divided it into five corps : the centre , two wings , vanguards and rearguards , following the same formation while on march or on a battle field . marwan ii ( 740–50 ) abandoned the old division and introduced kurdus ( cohort ) , a small compact body . the umayyad troops were divided into three divisions : infantry , cavalry and artillery . arab troops were dressed and armed in greek fashion . the umayyad cavalry used plain and round saddles . the artillery used arradah ( ballista ) , manjaniq ( the mangonel ) and dabbabah or kabsh ( the battering ram ) . the heavy engines , siege machines and baggage were carried on camels behind the army .
in his harvard " lectures on pragmatism " ( 1903 ) , peirce enumerated what he called the " three cotary propositions of pragmatism " ( l : cos , cotis whetstone ) , saying that they " put the edge on the maxim of pragmatism " . first among these he listed the peripatetic-thomist observation mentioned above , but he further observed that this link between sensory perception and intellectual conception is a two-way street . that is , it can be taken to say that whatever we find in the intellect is also incipiently in the senses . hence , if theories are theory-laden then so are the senses , and perception itself can be seen as a species of abductive inference , its difference being that it is beyond control and hence beyond critique – in a word , incorrigible . this in no way conflicts with the fallibility and revisability of scientific concepts , since it is only the immediate percept in its unique individuality or " thisness " – what the scholastics called its haecceity – that stands beyond control and correction . scientific concepts , on the other hand , are general in nature , and transient sensations do in another sense find correction within them . this notion of perception as abduction has received periodic revivals in artificial intelligence and cognitive science research , most recently for instance with the work of irvin rock on indirect perception .
after the establishment of hampshire county council , following the act in 1888 , southampton became a county borough within the county of hampshire , which meant that it had many features of a county , but governance was now shared between the corporation in southampton and the new county council . there is a great source of confusion in the fact that the ancient shire county , along with its associated assizes , was known as the county of southampton or southamptonshire . this was officially changed to hampshire in 1959 although the county had been commonly known as hampshire or hantscire for centuries . southampton became a non-metropolitan district in 1974 .
in 1566 , the first police investigator of rio de janeiro was recruited . by the 17th century , most captaincies already had local units with law enforcement functions . on july 9 , 1775 a cavalry regiment was created in the state of minas gerais for maintaining law and order . in 1808 , the portuguese royal family relocated to brazil , because of the french invasion of portugal . king joão vi established the " intendência geral de polícia " ( general police intendancy ) for investigations . he also created a royal police guard for rio de janeiro in 1809 . in 1831 , after independence , each province started organizing its local " military police " , with order maintenance tasks . the federal railroad police was created in 1852 .
nicknamed " the walking city " , boston hosts more pedestrian commuters than do other comparably populated cities . owing to factors such as the compactness of the city and large student population , 13 percent of the population commutes by foot , making it the highest percentage of pedestrian commuters in the country out of the major american cities . in 2011 , walk score ranked boston the third most walkable city in the united states . as of 2015 [ update ] , walk score still ranks boston as the third most walkable us city , with a walk score of 80 , a transit score of 75 , and a bike score of 70 .
over three quarters of the student body has some proficiency in a second language ( numbering 107 languages in total ) . this is partially due to the fact that 45 percent of the student body at byu has been missionaries for lds church , and many of them learned a foreign language as part of their mission assignment . during any given semester , about one-third of the student body is enrolled in foreign language classes , a rate nearly four times the national average . byu offers courses in over 60 different languages , many with advanced courses that are seldom offered elsewhere . several of its language programs are the largest of their kind in the nation , the russian program being one example . the university was selected by the united states department of education as the location of the national middle east language resource center , making the school a hub for experts on that region . it was also selected as a center for international business education research , a function of which is to train business employees in international languages and relations .
public demand caused the government in october 1940 to build new deep shelters:189–190 within the underground to hold 80,000 people but were not completed until the period of heaviest bombing had passed . by the end of 1940 significant improvements had been made in the underground and in many other large shelters . authorities provided stoves and bathrooms and canteen trains provided food . tickets were issued for bunks in large shelters to reduce the amount of time spent queuing . committees quickly formed within shelters as informal governments , and organisations such as the british red cross and the salvation army worked to improve conditions . entertainment included concerts , films , plays and books from local libraries .
also , the tradition of differentiating between the coat of arms proper and a lozenge granted to women did not develop in poland . usually men inherited the coat of arms from their fathers . also , the brisure was rarely used .
the relational model also allowed the content of the database to evolve without constant rewriting of links and pointers . the relational part comes from entities referencing other entities in what is known as one-to-many relationship , like a traditional hierarchical model , and many-to-many relationship , like a navigational ( network ) model . thus , a relational model can express both hierarchical and navigational models , as well as its native tabular model , allowing for pure or combined modeling in terms of these three models , as the application requires .
musée territorial de st.-barthélemy is a historical museum known as the " st. barts municipal museum " also called the " wall house " ( musée – bibliothèque ) in gustavia , which is located on the far end of la pointe . the museum is housed in an old stone house , a two-storey building which has been refurbished . the island ’ s history relating to french , swedish and british period of occupation is well presented in the museum with photographs , maps and paintings . also on display are the ancestral costumes , antique tools , models of creole houses and ancient fishing boats . it also houses a library .
trade secret misappropriation is different from violations of other intellectual property laws , since by definition trade secrets are secret , while patents and registered copyrights and trademarks are publicly available . in the united states , trade secrets are protected under state law , and states have nearly universally adopted the uniform trade secrets act . the united states also has federal law in the form of the economic espionage act of 1996 ( 18 u.s.c . §§ 1831–1839 ) , which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime . this law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity . the first , 18 u.s.c . § 1831 ( a ) , criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers . the second , 18 u.s.c . § 1832 , criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes . ( the statutory penalties are different for the two offenses . ) in commonwealth common law jurisdictions , confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an equitable right rather than a property right but penalties for theft are roughly the same as the united states .

season four premiered on january 18 , 2005 ; this was the first season of the series to be aired in high definition , although the finale of season three was also aired in high definition . the number of those attending the auditions by now had increased to over 100,000 from the 10,000 of the first season . the age limit was raised to 28 in this season , and among those who benefited from this new rule were constantine maroulis and bo bice , the two rockers of the show .
due to extreme variation in elevation , great variation occurs in the climatic conditions of himachal . the climate varies from hot and subhumid tropical in the southern tracts to , with more elevation , cold , alpine , and glacial in the northern and eastern mountain ranges . the state has areas like dharamsala that receive very heavy rainfall , as well as those like lahaul and spiti that are cold and almost rainless . broadly , himachal experiences three seasons : summer , winter , and rainy season . summer lasts from mid-april till the end of june and most parts become very hot ( except in the alpine zone which experiences a mild summer ) with the average temperature ranging from 28 to 32 °c ( 82 to 90 °f ) . winter lasts from late november till mid march . snowfall is common in alpine tracts ( generally above 2,200 metres ( 7,218 ft ) i.e . in the higher and trans-himalayan region ) .
the causes of the franco-prussian war are deeply rooted in the events surrounding the unification of germany . in the aftermath of the austro–prussian war of 1866 , prussia had annexed numerous territories and formed the north german confederation . this new power destabilized the european balance of power established by the congress of vienna in 1815 after the napoleonic wars . napoleon iii , then the emperor of france , demanded compensations in belgium and on the left bank of the rhine to secure france 's strategic position , which the prussian chancellor , otto von bismarck , flatly refused . prussia then turned its attention towards the south of germany , where it sought to incorporate the southern german kingdoms , bavaria , württemberg , baden and hesse-darmstadt , into a unified prussia-dominated germany . france was strongly opposed to any further alliance of german states , which would have significantly strengthened the prussian military .
the state of tennessee is rooted in the watauga association , a 1772 frontier pact generally regarded as the first constitutional government west of the appalachians . what is now tennessee was initially part of north carolina , and later part of the southwest territory . tennessee was admitted to the union as the 16th state on june 1 , 1796 . tennessee was the last state to leave the union and join the confederacy at the outbreak of the u.s. civil war in 1861 . occupied by union forces from 1862 , it was the first state to be readmitted to the union at the end of the war .
energy production in greece is dominated by the public power corporation ( known mostly by its acronym δεη , or in english dei ) . in 2009 dei supplied for 85.6 % of all energy demand in greece , while the number fell to 77.3 % in 2010 . almost half ( 48 % ) of dei 's power output is generated using lignite , a drop from the 51.6 % in 2009 . another 12 % comes from hydroelectric power plants and another 20 % from natural gas . between 2009 and 2010 , independent companies ' energy production increased by 56 % , from 2,709 gigawatt hour in 2009 to 4,232 gwh in 2010 .
immanuel kant ( 1724–1804 ) tried to reconcile rationalism and religious belief , individual freedom and political authority , as well as map out a view of the public sphere through private and public reason . kant 's work continued to shape german thought , and indeed all of european philosophy , well into the 20th century . mary wollstonecraft was one of england 's earliest feminist philosophers . she argued for a society based on reason , and that women , as well as men , should be treated as rational beings . she is best known for her work a vindication of the rights of woman ( 1791 ) .
after napoleon imposed the convention of artlenburg ( convention of the elbe ) on july 5 , 1803 , about 30,000 french soldiers occupied hanover . the convention also required disbanding the army of hanover . however , george iii did not recognize the convention of the elbe . this resulted in a great number of soldiers from hanover eventually emigrating to great britain , where the king 's german legion was formed . it was the only german army to fight against france throughout the entire napoleonic wars . the legion later played an important role in the battle of waterloo in 1815 . the congress of vienna in 1815 elevated the electorate to the kingdom of hanover . the capital town hanover expanded to the western bank of the leine and since then has grown considerably .
the arians no longer presented an unbroken front to their orthodox opponents . the emperor constantius , who had been the cause of so much trouble , died 4 november , 361 and was succeeded by julian . the proclamation of the new prince 's accession was the signal for a pagan outbreak against the still dominant arian faction in alexandria . george , the usurping bishop , was flung into prison and murdered . an obscure presbyter of the name of pistus was immediately chosen by the arians to succeed him , when fresh news arrived that filled the orthodox party with hope . an edict had been put forth by julian permitting the exiled bishops of the " galileans " to return to their " towns and provinces " . athanasius received a summons from his own flock , and he accordingly re-entered his episcopal capitol on 22 february , 362 .
after reconquering estonia and latvia in 1944 , the russian sfsr annexed their easternmost territories around ivangorod and within the modern pechorsky and pytalovsky districts in 1944-1945 .
on december 16 , 2015 , the supreme court of india mandated several restrictions on delhi 's transportation system to curb pollution . among the measures , the court ordered to stop registrations of diesel cars and sport utility vehicles with an engine capacity of 2,000 cc and over until march 31 , 2016 . the court also ordered all taxis in the delhi region to switch to compressed natural gas by march 1 , 2016 . transportation vehicles that are more than 10 years old were banned from entering the capital .
meetings for worship and study are held at kingdom halls , which are typically functional in character , and do not contain religious symbols . witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose " territory " they usually reside and attend weekly services they refer to as " meetings " as scheduled by congregation elders . the meetings are largely devoted to study of watch tower society literature and the bible . the format of the meetings is established by the religion 's headquarters , and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide . congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising five distinct meetings that total about three-and-a-half hours , typically gathering mid-week ( three meetings ) and on the weekend ( two meetings ) . prior to 2009 , congregations met three times each week ; these meetings were condensed , with the intention that members dedicate an evening for " family worship " . gatherings are opened and closed with kingdom songs ( hymns ) and brief prayers . twice each year , witnesses from a number of congregations that form a " circuit " gather for a one-day assembly . larger groups of congregations meet once a year for a three-day " regional convention " , usually at rented stadiums or auditoriums . their most important and solemn event is the commemoration of the " lord 's evening meal " , or " memorial of christ 's death " on the date of the jewish passover .
possibly in part due to expedited federal habeas corpus procedures embodied in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 , the pace of executions picked up , reaching a peak of 98 in 1999 and then they declined gradually to 28 in 2015 . since the death penalty was reauthorized in 1976 , 1,411 people have been executed , almost exclusively by the states , with most occurring after 1990 . texas has accounted for over one-third of modern executions ( although only two death sentences were imposed in texas during 2015 , with the courts preferring to issue sentences of life without parole instead ) and over four times as many as oklahoma , the state with the second-highest number . california has the greatest number of prisoners on death row , has issued the highest number of death sentences but has held relatively few executions .
in the attempt to satisfy austria at the time , britain gave their electoral vote in hanover for the candidacy of maria theresa 's son , joseph , as the holy roman emperor , much to the dismay of frederick and prussia . not only that , britain would soon join the austro-russian alliance , but complications arose . britain 's basic framework for the alliance itself was to protect hanover 's interests against france . while at the same time , kaunitz kept approaching the french in the hope of establishing such alliance with austria . not only that , france had no intention to ally with russia , who meddled with their affairs in austria 's succession war , years earlier , and saw the complete dismemberment of prussia as unacceptable to the stability of central europe .
queen drew artistic influence from british rock acts of the 1960s and early 1970s , such as the beatles , the kinks , cream , led zeppelin , pink floyd , the who , black sabbath , slade , deep purple , david bowie , genesis and yes , in addition to american guitarist jimi hendrix , with mercury also inspired by the gospel singer aretha franklin . may referred to the beatles as being " our bible in the way they used the studio and they painted pictures and this wonderful instinctive use of harmonies . " at their outset in the early 1970s , queen 's music has been characterised as " led zeppelin meets yes " due to its combination of " acoustic/electric guitar extremes and fantasy-inspired multi-part song epics " .
in most parts of medieval europe , the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory . game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs , often provided via professional huntsmen , but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy . the importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the robin hood legends , in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they " hunt the king 's deer " . in contrast , settlers in anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all .
as a cardinal , montini journeyed to africa ( 1962 ) , where he visited ghana , sudan , kenya , congo , rhodesia , south africa , and nigeria . after his journey , john xxiii gave him a private audience on his trip which lasted for several hours . in fifteen other trips he visited brazil ( 1960 ) and the usa ( 1960 ) , including new york city , washington , dc , chicago , the university of notre dame in indiana , boston , philadelphia , and baltimore . while a cardinal , he usually vacationed in engelberg abbey , a secluded benedictine monastery in switzerland .
basic sanitation techniques can have a profound effect on the transmission of diarrheal disease . the implementation of hand washing using soap and water , for example , has been experimentally shown to reduce the incidence of disease by approximately 42–48 % . hand washing in developing countries , however , is compromised by poverty as acknowledged by the cdc : " handwashing is integral to disease prevention in all parts of the world ; however , access to soap and water is limited in a number of less developed countries . this lack of access is one of many challenges to proper hygiene in less developed countries . " solutions to this barrier require the implementation of educational programs that encourage sanitary behaviours .
presbyterian government is by councils ( known as courts ) of elders . teaching and ruling elders are ordained and convene in the lowest council known as a session or consistory responsible for the discipline , nurture , and mission of the local congregation . teaching elders ( pastors ) have responsibility for teaching , worship , and performing sacraments . pastors are called by individual congregations . a congregation issues a call for the pastor 's service , but this call must be ratified by the local presbytery .
kanye west began his early production career in the mid-1990s , making beats primarily for burgeoning local artists , eventually developing a style that involved speeding up vocal samples from classic soul records . his first official production credits came at the age of nineteen when he produced eight tracks on down to earth , the 1996 debut album of a chicago rapper named grav . for a time , west acted as a ghost producer for deric " d-dot " angelettie . because of his association with d-dot , west was n't able to release a solo album , so he formed and became a member and producer of the go-getters , a late-1990s chicago rap group composed of him , glc , timmy g , really doe , and arrowstar . his group was managed by john " monopoly " johnson , don crowley , and happy lewis under the management firm hustle period . after attending a series of promotional photo shoots and making some radio appearances , the go-getters released their first and only studio album world record holders in 1999 . the album featured other chicago-based rappers such as rhymefest , mikkey halsted , miss criss , and shayla g. meanwhile , the production was handled by west , arrowstar , boogz , and brian " all day " miller .
as a uniformed military service , the army is part of the department of the army , which is one of the three military departments of the department of defense . the u.s. army is headed by a civilian senior appointed civil servant , the secretary of the army ( secarmy ) , and by a chief military officer , the chief of staff of the army ( csa ) who is also a member of the joint chiefs of staff . in the fiscal year 2016 , the projected end strength for the regular army ( usa ) was 475,000 soldiers ; the army national guard ( arng ) had 342,000 soldiers , and the united states army reserve ( usar ) had 198,000 soldiers ; the combined-component strength of the u.s. army was 1,015,000 soldiers . as a branch of the armed forces , the mission of the u.s. army is " to fight and win our nation 's wars , by providing prompt , sustained , land dominance , across the full range of military operations and the spectrum of conflict , in support of combatant commanders . " the service participates in conflicts worldwide and is the major ground-based offensive and defensive force .
myanmar 's armed forces are known as the tatmadaw , which numbers 488,000 . the tatmadaw comprises the army , the navy , and the air force . the country ranked twelfth in the world for its number of active troops in service . the military is very influential in myanmar , with all top cabinet and ministry posts usually held by military officials . official figures for military spending are not available . estimates vary widely because of uncertain exchange rates , but myanmar 's military forces ' expenses are high . myanmar imports most of its weapons from russia , ukraine , china and india .
a scientific study in the journal , biological conservation , states that trophy hunting is of " major importance to conservation in africa by creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas , including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative wildlife-based land uses such as photographic ecotourism . " however , another study states that less than 3 % of a trophy hunters ' expenditures reach the local level , meaning that the economic incentive and benefit is " minimal , particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that hunting concessions occupy . "
he attained a perfect score on the graduate school entrance exams to princeton university in mathematics and physics—an unprecedented feat—but did rather poorly on the history and english portions . attendees at feynman 's first seminar included albert einstein , wolfgang pauli , and john von neumann . he received a phd from princeton in 1942 ; his thesis advisor was john archibald wheeler . feynman 's thesis applied the principle of stationary action to problems of quantum mechanics , inspired by a desire to quantize the wheeler–feynman absorber theory of electrodynamics , laying the groundwork for the " path integral " approach and feynman diagrams , and was titled " the principle of least action in quantum mechanics " .
for guidance in practical application of jewish law , the majority of orthodox jews appeal to the shulchan aruch ( " code of jewish law " composed in the 16th century by rabbi joseph caro ) together with its surrounding commentaries . thus , at a general level , there is a large degree of uniformity amongst all orthodox jews . concerning the details , however , there is often variance : decisions may be based on various of the standardized codes of jewish law that have been developed over the centuries , as well as on the various responsa . these codes and responsa may differ from each other as regards detail ( and reflecting the above philosophical differences , as regards the weight assigned to these ) . by and large , however , the differences result from the historic dispersal of the jews and the consequent development of differences among regions in their practices ( see minhag ) .
a resin used for making non-wrinkle shirts releases formaldehyde , which could cause contact dermatitis for some people ; no disclosure requirements exist , and in 2008 the u.s. government accountability office tested formaldehyde in clothing and found that generally the highest levels were in non-wrinkle shirts and pants . in 1999 , a study of the effect of washing on the formaldehyde levels found that after 6 months after washing , 7 of 27 shirts had levels in excess of 75 ppm , which is a safe limit for direct skin exposure .
since before 2000 bc , humans have utilized pesticides to protect their crops . the first known pesticide was elemental sulfur dusting used in ancient sumer about 4,500 years ago in ancient mesopotamia . the rig veda , which is about 4,000 years old , mentions the use of poisonous plants for pest control . by the 15th century , toxic chemicals such as arsenic , mercury , and lead were being applied to crops to kill pests . in the 17th century , nicotine sulfate was extracted from tobacco leaves for use as an insecticide . the 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides , pyrethrum , which is derived from chrysanthemums , and rotenone , which is derived from the roots of tropical vegetables . until the 1950s , arsenic-based pesticides were dominant . paul müller discovered that ddt was a very effective insecticide . organochlorines such as ddt were dominant , but they were replaced in the u.s. by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975 . since then , pyrethrin compounds have become the dominant insecticide . herbicides became common in the 1960s , led by " triazine and other nitrogen-based compounds , carboxylic acids such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid , and glyphosate " .
even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture , hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply . the supplementary meat and materials from hunting included protein , bone for implements , sinew for cordage , fur , feathers , rawhide and leather used in clothing . man 's earliest hunting weapons would have included rocks , spears , the atlatl , and bows and arrows . hunting is still vital in marginal climates , especially those unsuited for pastoral uses or agriculture . [ citation needed ] for example , inuit people in the arctic trap and hunt animals for clothing and use the skins of sea mammals to make kayaks , clothing , and footwear .
in 1892 captain davis of the hms royalist reported on trading activities and traders on each of the islands visited . captain davis identified the following traders in the ellice group : edmund duffy ( nanumea ) ; jack buckland ( niutao ) ; harry nitz ( vaitupu ) ; john ( also known as jack ) o'brien ( funafuti ) ; alfred restieaux and emile fenisot ( nukufetau ) ; and martin kleis ( nui ) . during this time , the greatest number of palagi traders lived on the atolls , acting as agents for the trading companies . some islands would have competing traders while dryer islands might only have a single trader .
madonna was criticized for her performance of " like a virgin " at the first 1984 mtv video music awards ( vma ) . she appeared on stage atop a giant wedding cake , wearing a wedding dress and white gloves . the performance is noted by mtv as an iconic moment in vma history . in later years , madonna commented that she was terrified of the performance . the next hit was " material girl " promoted by her video , a mimicry of marilyn monroe 's performance of the song " diamonds are a girl 's best friend " from the 1953 film gentlemen prefer blondes . while filming this video , madonna started dating actor sean penn . they married on her birthday in 1985 . like a virgin was certified diamond by the recording industry association of america and sold more than 25 million copies worldwide . in february 1984 , according to the film director sir richard attenborough , madonna auditioned at the royale theatre on broadway for a dance role in his movie version of a chorus line using her birth-name of ciccone , but he rejected her .
before the advent of the asa system , the system of weston film speed ratings was introduced by edward faraday weston ( 1878–1971 ) and his father dr. edward weston ( 1850–1936 ) , a british-born electrical engineer , industrialist and founder of the us-based weston electrical instrument corporation , with the weston model 617 , one of the earliest photo-electric exposure meters , in august 1932 . the meter and film rating system were invented by william nelson goodwin , jr. , who worked for them and later received a howard n. potts medal for his contributions to engineering .
the defined dogma of the immaculate conception regards original sin only , saying that mary was preserved from any stain ( in latin , macula or labes , the second of these two synonymous words being the one used in the formal definition ) . the proclaimed roman catholic dogma states " that the most blessed virgin mary , in the first instance of her conception , by a singular grace and privilege granted by almighty god , in view of the merits of jesus christ , the saviour of the human race , was preserved free from all stain of original sin . " therefore , being always free from original sin , the doctrine teaches that from her conception mary received the sanctifying grace that would normally come with baptism after birth .
west 's fourth studio album , 808s & heartbreak ( 2008 ) , marked an even more radical departure from his previous releases , largely abandoning rap and hip hop stylings in favor of a stark electropop sound composed of virtual synthesis , the roland tr-808 drum machine , and explicitly auto-tuned vocal tracks . drawing inspiration from artists such as gary numan , tj swan and boy george , and maintaining a " minimal but functional " approach towards the album 's studio production , west explored the electronic feel produced by auto-tune and utilized the sounds created by the 808 , manipulating its pitch to produce a distorted , electronic sound ; he then sought to juxtapose mechanical sounds with the traditional sounds of taiko drums and choir monks . the album 's music features austere production and elements such as dense drums , lengthy strings , droning synthesizers , and somber piano , and drew comparisons to the work of 1980s post-punk and new wave groups , with west himself later confessing an affinity with british post-punk group joy division . rolling stone journalist matthew trammell asserted that the record was ahead of its time and wrote in a 2012 article , " now that popular music has finally caught up to it , 808s & heartbreak has revealed itself to be kanye ’ s most vulnerable work , and perhaps his most brilliant . "
the history of the ottoman empire during world war i began with the ottoman engagement in the middle eastern theatre . there were several important ottoman victories in the early years of the war , such as the battle of gallipoli and the siege of kut . the arab revolt which began in 1916 turned the tide against the ottomans on the middle eastern front , where they initially seemed to have the upper hand during the first two years of the war . the armistice of mudros was signed on 30 october 1918 , and set the partition of the ottoman empire under the terms of the treaty of sèvres . this treaty , as designed in the conference of london , allowed the sultan to retain his position and title . the occupation of constantinople and izmir led to the establishment of a turkish national movement , which won the turkish war of independence ( 1919–22 ) under the leadership of mustafa kemal ( later given the surname " atatürk " ) . the sultanate was abolished on 1 november 1922 , and the last sultan , mehmed vi ( reigned 1918–22 ) , left the country on 17 november 1922 . the caliphate was abolished on 3 march 1924 .
besides prince william and prince harry , members of the extended british royal family who have attended eton include prince richard , duke of gloucester and his son alexander windsor , earl of ulster ; prince edward , duke of kent , his eldest son george windsor , earl of st andrews and grandson edward windsor , lord downpatrick and his youngest son lord nicholas windsor ; prince michael of kent and his son lord frederick windsor ; james ogilvy , son of princess alexandra and the right honourable angus ogilvy , himself an eton alumnus . prince william of gloucester ( 1942-1972 ) also attended eton , as did george lascelles , 7th earl of harewood , son of princess mary , princess royal .
the competition is open to any club down to level 10 of the english football league system which meets the eligibility criteria . all clubs in the top four levels ( the premier league and the three divisions of the football league ) are automatically eligible . clubs in the next six levels ( non-league football ) are also eligible provided they have played in either the fa cup , fa trophy or fa vase competitions in the previous season . newly formed clubs , such as f.c . united of manchester in 2005–06 and also 2006–07 , may not therefore play in the fa cup in their first season . all clubs entering the competition must also have a suitable stadium .
large numbers of bolivian highland peasants retained indigenous language , culture , customs , and communal organization throughout the spanish conquest and the post-independence period . they mobilized to resist various attempts at the dissolution of communal landholdings and used legal recognition of " empowered caciques " to further communal organization . indigenous revolts took place frequently until 1953 . while the national revolutionary movement government begun in 1952 discouraged self-identification as indigenous ( reclassifying rural people as campesinos , or peasants ) , renewed ethnic and class militancy re-emerged in the katarista movement beginning in the 1970s . lowland indigenous peoples , mostly in the east , entered national politics through the 1990 march for territory and dignity organized by the cidob confederation . that march successfully pressured the national government to sign the ilo convention 169 and to begin the still-ongoing process of recognizing and titling indigenous territories . the 1994 law of popular participation granted " grassroots territorial organizations " that are recognized by the state certain rights to govern local areas .
maximum power transfer requires matching the impedance of an antenna system ( as seen looking into the transmission line ) to the complex conjugate of the impedance of the receiver or transmitter . in the case of a transmitter , however , the desired matching impedance might not correspond to the dynamic output impedance of the transmitter as analyzed as a source impedance but rather the design value ( typically 50 ohms ) required for efficient and safe operation of the transmitting circuitry . the intended impedance is normally resistive but a transmitter ( and some receivers ) may have additional adjustments to cancel a certain amount of reactance in order to " tweak " the match . when a transmission line is used in between the antenna and the transmitter ( or receiver ) one generally would like an antenna system whose impedance is resistive and near the characteristic impedance of that transmission line in order to minimize the standing wave ratio ( swr ) and the increase in transmission line losses it entails , in addition to supplying a good match at the transmitter or receiver itself .
with a population of 518,000 , hanover is a major centre of northern germany and the country 's thirteenth largest city . hanover also hosts annual commercial trade fairs such as the hanover fair and the cebit . every year hanover hosts the schützenfest hannover , the world 's largest marksmen 's festival , and the oktoberfest hannover , the second largest oktoberfest in the world ( beside oktoberfest of blumenau ) . in 2000 , hanover hosted the world fair expo 2000 . the hanover fairground , due to numerous extensions , especially for the expo 2000 , is the largest in the world . hanover is of national importance because of its universities and medical school , its international airport and its large zoo . the city is also a major crossing point of railway lines and highways ( autobahnen ) , connecting european main lines in both the east-west ( berlin–ruhr area ) and north-south ( hamburg–munich , etc . ) directions .
riba enterprises is the commercial arm of riba , with a registered office in newcastle upon tyne , a base at 15 bonhill street in london , and an office in newark . it employs over 250 staff , approximately 180 of whom are based in newcastle .
american idol employs a panel of judges who critique the contestants ' performances . the original judges were record producer and music manager randy jackson , pop singer and choreographer paula abdul and music executive and manager simon cowell . the judging panel for the most recent season consisted of country singer keith urban , singer and actress jennifer lopez , and jazz singer harry connick , jr . the show was originally hosted by radio personality ryan seacrest and comedian brian dunkleman , with seacrest continuing on for the rest of the seasons .
inside ornament was far more generous , and could sometimes be overwhelming . the chimneypiece continued to be the usual main focus of rooms , and was now given a classical treatment , and increasingly topped by a painting or a mirror . plasterwork ceilings , carved wood , and bold schemes of wallpaint formed a backdrop to increasingly rich collections of furniture , paintings , porcelain , mirrors , and objets d'art of all kinds . wood-panelling , very common since about 1500 , fell from favour around the mid-century , and wallpaper included very expensive imports from china .
the tribes were ruled by clans ( ród ) consisting of people related by blood or marriage and theoretically descending from a common ancestor , giving the ród/clan a highly developed sense of solidarity . ( see gens . ) the starosta ( or starszyna ) had judicial and military power over the ród/clan , although this power was often exercised with an assembly of elders . strongholds called grόd were built where the religious cult was powerful , where trials were conducted , and where clans gathered in the face of danger . the opole was the territory occupied by a single tribe . ( manteuffel 1982 , p. 44 )
to the east of the county are upland areas leading to the pennines . north of the ribble is beacon fell country park and the forest of bowland , another aonb . much of the lowland in this area is devoted to dairy farming and cheesemaking , whereas the higher ground is more suitable for sheep , and the highest ground is uncultivated moorland . the valleys of the river ribble and its tributary the calder form a large gap to the west of the pennines , overlooked by pendle hill . most of the larger lancashire towns are in these valleys south of the ribble are the west pennine moors and the forest of rossendale where former cotton mill towns are in deep valleys . the lancashire coalfield , largely in modern-day greater manchester , extended into merseyside and to ormskirk , chorley , burnley and colne in lancashire .
the firm continued to pressure kelsey and the agency to approve the application—until november 1961 , when the drug was pulled off the german market because of its association with grave congenital abnormalities . several thousand newborns in europe and elsewhere suffered the teratogenic effects of thalidomide . though the drug was never approved in the usa , the firm distributed kevadon to over 1,000 physicians there under the guise of investigational use . over 20,000 americans received thalidomide in this " study , " including 624 pregnant patients , and about 17 known newborns suffered the effects of the drug .

there are traditions long associated with football games . students growl like wildcats when the opposing team controls the ball , while simulating a paw with their hands . they will also jingle keys at the beginning of each kickoff . in the past , before the tradition was discontinued , students would throw marshmallows during games . the clock tower at the rebecca crown center glows purple , instead of its usual white , after a winning game , thereby proclaiming the happy news . the clock tower remains purple until a loss or until the end of the sports season . whereas formerly the clock tower was lighted only for football victories , wins for men 's basketball and women 's lacrosse now merit commemoration as well ; important victories in other sports may also prompt an empurpling .
in whitehead 's view , then , concepts such as " quality " , " matter " , and " form " are problematic . these " classical " concepts fail to adequately account for change , and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world . they are useful abstractions , but are not the world 's basic building blocks . what is ordinarily conceived of as a single person , for instance , is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events . after all , people change all the time , if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience . these occasions of experience are logically distinct , but are progressively connected in what whitehead calls a " society " of events . by assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe , materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete ( what whitehead calls the " fallacy of misplaced concreteness " ) .
the last major building work took place during the reign of king george v when , in 1913 , sir aston webb redesigned blore 's 1850 east front to resemble in part giacomo leoni 's lyme park in cheshire . this new , refaced principal façade ( of portland stone ) was designed to be the backdrop to the victoria memorial , a large memorial statue of queen victoria , placed outside the main gates . george v , who had succeeded edward vii in 1910 , had a more serious personality than his father ; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties . he arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the original dixieland jazz band ( 1919 ) – the first jazz performance for a head of state , sidney bechet , and louis armstrong ( 1932 ) , which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a ( kind of ) blue plaque by the brecon jazz festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the united kingdom . george v 's wife queen mary was a connoisseur of the arts , and took a keen interest in the royal collection of furniture and art , both restoring and adding to it . queen mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed , such as the pair of marble empire-style chimneypieces by benjamin vulliamy , dating from 1810 , which the queen had installed in the ground floor bow room , the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade . queen mary was also responsible for the decoration of the blue drawing room . this room , 69 feet ( 21 metres ) long , previously known as the south drawing room , has a ceiling designed specially by nash , coffered with huge gilt console brackets .
the numbered streets carry crosstown traffic . in general , even-numbered streets are one-way eastbound and odd-numbered streets are one-way west . several exceptions reverse this . most wider streets carry two-way traffic , as do a few of the narrow ones .

microsoft released minimum hardware requirements for tablet and laplet devices to be " certified " for windows 8 , and defined a convertible form factor as a standalone device that combines the pc , display and rechargeable power source with a mechanically attached keyboard and pointing device in a single chassis . a convertible can be transformed into a tablet where the attached input devices are hidden or removed leaving the display as the only input mechanism . on march 12 , 2013 , microsoft amended its certification requirements to only require that screens on tablets have a minimum resolution of 1024×768 ( down from the previous 1366×768 ) . the amended requirement is intended to allow " greater design flexibility " for future products .
during the cambrian period , gondwana had a mild climate . west antarctica was partially in the northern hemisphere , and during this period large amounts of sandstones , limestones and shales were deposited . east antarctica was at the equator , where sea floor invertebrates and trilobites flourished in the tropical seas . by the start of the devonian period ( 416 ma ) , gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler , though fossils of land plants are known from this time . sand and silts were laid down in what is now the ellsworth , horlick and pensacola mountains . glaciation began at the end of the devonian period ( 360 ma ) , as gondwana became centered on the south pole and the climate cooled , though flora remained . during the permian period , the land became dominated by seed plants such as glossopteris , a pteridosperm which grew in swamps . over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the transantarctic mountains . towards the end of the permian period , continued warming led to a dry , hot climate over much of gondwana .
following various military conquests in the greek east , romans adapted a number of greek educational precepts to their own fledgling system . they began physical training to prepare the boys to grow as roman citizens and for eventual recruitment into the army . conforming to discipline was a point of great emphasis . girls generally received instruction from their mothers in the art of spinning , weaving , and sewing . schooling in a more formal sense was begun around 200 bc . education began at the age of around six , and in the next six to seven years , boys and girls were expected to learn the basics of reading , writing and counting . by the age of twelve , they would be learning latin , greek , grammar and literature , followed by training for public speaking . oratory was an art to be practiced and learnt , and good orators commanded respect .

spectre has received mixed reviews , with many reviewers either giving the film highly positive or highly negative feedback . many critics praised the film 's opening scene , action sequences , stuntwork , cinematography and performances from the cast . in some early reviews , the film received favourable comparisons with its predecessor , skyfall . rotten tomatoes sampled 274 reviews and judged 64 % of the critiques to be positive , saying that the film " nudges daniel craig 's rebooted bond closer to the glorious , action-driven spectacle of earlier entries , although it 's admittedly reliant on established 007 formula . " on metacritic , the film has a rating of 60 out of 100 , based on 48 critics , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of " a− " on an a+ to f scale .
about 10,000 years ago , when the ice melted after the last glacial period , late paleolithic communities were established along the lake shores and in cave systems . evidence of human habitation has been found in caves near vercors , close to grenoble ; in austria the mondsee culture shows evidence of houses built on piles to keep them dry . standing stones have been found in alpine areas of france and italy . the rock drawings in valcamonica are more than 5000 years old ; more than 200,000 drawings and etchings have been identified at the site .
in 1808 bavarian educational commissioner friedrich immanuel niethammer coined the term humanismus to describe the new classical curriculum he planned to offer in german secondary schools , and by 1836 the word " humanism " had been absorbed into the english language in this sense . the coinage gained universal acceptance in 1856 , when german historian and philologist georg voigt used humanism to describe renaissance humanism , the movement that flourished in the italian renaissance to revive classical learning , a use which won wide acceptance among historians in many nations , especially italy .
chopin has figured extensively in polish literature , both in serious critical studies of his life and music and in fictional treatments . the earliest manifestation was probably an 1830 sonnet on chopin by leon ulrich . french writers on chopin ( apart from sand ) have included marcel proust and andré gide ; and he has also featured in works of gottfried benn and boris pasternak . there are numerous biographies of chopin in english ( see bibliography for some of these ) .
the causes of the franco-prussian war are deeply rooted in the events surrounding the unification of germany . in the aftermath of the austro–prussian war of 1866 , prussia had annexed numerous territories and formed the north german confederation . this new power destabilized the european balance of power established by the congress of vienna in 1815 after the napoleonic wars . napoleon iii , then the emperor of france , demanded compensations in belgium and on the left bank of the rhine to secure france 's strategic position , which the prussian chancellor , otto von bismarck , flatly refused . prussia then turned its attention towards the south of germany , where it sought to incorporate the southern german kingdoms , bavaria , württemberg , baden and hesse-darmstadt , into a unified prussia-dominated germany . france was strongly opposed to any further alliance of german states , which would have significantly strengthened the prussian military .
starting at the transition between the middle to upper paleolithic period , some 80,000 to 70,000 years ago , some hunter-gatherers bands began to specialize , concentrating on hunting a smaller selection of ( often larger ) game and gathering a smaller selection of food . this specialization of work also involved creating specialized tools , like fishing nets and hooks and bone harpoons . the transition into the subsequent neolithic period is chiefly defined by the unprecedented development of nascent agricultural practices . agriculture originated and spread in several different areas including the middle east , asia , mesoamerica , and the andes beginning as early as 12,000 years ago .
kerry established a separate political action committee , keeping america 's promise , which declared as its mandate " a democratic congress will restore accountability to washington and help change a disastrous course in iraq " , and raised money and channeled contributions to democratic candidates in state and federal races . through keeping america 's promise in 2005 , kerry raised over $ 5.5 million for other democrats up and down the ballot . through his campaign account and his political action committee , the kerry campaign operation generated more than $ 10 million for various party committees and 179 candidates for the u.s. house , senate , state and local offices in 42 states focusing on the midterm elections during the 2006 election cycle . " cumulatively , john kerry has done as much if not more than any other individual senator " , hassan nemazee , the national finance chairman of the dscc said .
the contemporary liberal party generally advocates economic liberalism ( see new right ) . historically , the party has supported a higher degree of economic protectionism and interventionism than it has in recent decades . however , from its foundation the party has identified itself as anti-socialist . strong opposition to socialism and communism in australia and abroad was one of its founding principles . the party 's founder and longest-serving leader robert menzies envisaged that australia 's middle class would form its main constituency .

along with the general administration of the sport , football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game , dealing with issues such as comments to the press , clubs ' financial management , doping , age fraud and match fixing . most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game . some on-field incidents , if considered very serious ( such as allegations of racial abuse ) , may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card . some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh .
four boarders at his parents ' apartments became chopin 's intimates : tytus woyciechowski , jan nepomucen białobłocki , jan matuszyński and julian fontana ; the latter two would become part of his paris milieu . he was friendly with members of warsaw 's young artistic and intellectual world , including fontana , józef bohdan zaleski and stefan witwicki . he was also attracted to the singing student konstancja gładkowska . in letters to woyciechowski , he indicated which of his works , and even which of their passages , were influenced by his fascination with her ; his letter of 15 may 1830 revealed that the slow movement ( larghetto ) of his piano concerto no . 1 ( in e minor ) was secretly dedicated to her – " it should be like dreaming in beautiful springtime – by moonlight . " his final conservatory report ( july 1829 ) read : " chopin f. , third-year student , exceptional talent , musical genius . "
egocentrism in adolescents forms a self-conscious desire to feel important in their peer groups and enjoy social acceptance . unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept , identity represents a coherent sense of self stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals . everyone has a self-concept , whereas erik erikson argued that not everyone fully achieves identity . erikson 's theory of stages of development includes the identity crisis in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs . he described the resolution of this process as a stage of " identity achievement " but also stressed that the identity challenge " is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time " . adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their crowd membership . " clothes help teens explore new identities , separate from parents , and bond with peers . " fashion has played a major role when it comes to teenagers " finding their selves " ; fashion is always evolving , which corresponds with the evolution of change in the personality of teenagers . adolescents attempt to define their identity by consciously styling themselves in different manners to find what best suits them . trial and error in matching both their perceived image and the image others respond to and see , allows for the adolescent to grasp an understanding of who they are just as fashion is evolving to influence adolescents so is the media . " modern life takes place amidst a never-ending barrage of flesh on screens , pages , and billboards . " this barrage consciously or subconsciously registers into the mind causing issues with self-image a factor that contributes to an adolescence sense of identity . researcher james marcia developed the current method for testing an individual 's progress along these stages . his questions are divided into three categories : occupation , ideology , and interpersonal relationships . answers are scored based on extent to which the individual has explored and the degree to which he has made commitments . the result is classification of the individual into a ) identity diffusion in which all children begin , b ) identity foreclosure in which commitments are made without the exploration of alternatives , c ) moratorium , or the process of exploration , or d ) identity achievement in which moratorium has occurred and resulted in commitments .

these territories are sometimes referred to as the països catalans ( catalan countries ) , a denomination based on cultural affinity and common heritage , that has also had a subsequent political interpretation but no official status . various interpretations of the term may include some or all of these regions .
jerusalem with its many holy places probably had the highest concentration of mosaic-covered churches but very few of them survived the subsequent waves of destructions . the present remains do not do justice to the original richness of the city . the most important is the so-called " armenian mosaic " which was discovered in 1894 on the street of the prophets near damascus gate . it depicts a vine with many branches and grape clusters , which springs from a vase . populating the vine 's branches are peacocks , ducks , storks , pigeons , an eagle , a partridge , and a parrot in a cage . the inscription reads : " for the memory and salvation of all those armenians whose name the lord knows . " beneath a corner of the mosaic is a small , natural cave which contained human bones dating to the 5th or 6th centuries . the symbolism of the mosaic and the presence of the burial cave indicates that the room was used as a mortuary chapel .
in theravada buddhism there can be no divine salvation or forgiveness for one 's karma , since it is a purely impersonal process that is a part of the makeup of the universe . [ citation needed ] in mahayana buddhism , the texts of certain mahayana sutras ( such as the lotus sutra , the aṅgulimālīya sūtra and the mahāyāna mahāparinirvāṇa sūtra ) claim that the recitation or merely the hearing of their texts can expunge great swathes of negative karma . some forms of buddhism ( for example , vajrayana ) regard the recitation of mantras as a means for cutting off of previous negative karma . the japanese pure land teacher genshin taught that amitābha has the power to destroy the karma that would otherwise bind one in saṃsāra .
a 2001 study by nebel et al . showed that both ashkenazi and sephardic jewish populations share the same overall paternal near eastern ancestries . in comparison with data available from other relevant populations in the region , jews were found to be more closely related to groups in the north of the fertile crescent . the authors also report on eu 19 ( r1a ) chromosomes , which are very frequent in central and eastern europeans ( 54 % –60 % ) at elevated frequency ( 12.7 % ) in ashkenazi jews . they hypothesized that the differences among ashkenazim jews could reflect low-level gene flow from surrounding european populations and/or genetic drift during isolation . a later 2005 study by nebel et al. , found a similar level of 11.5 % of male ashkenazim belonging to r1a1a ( m17+ ) , the dominant y-chromosome haplogroup in central and eastern europeans .

the first successful light bulb filaments were made of carbon ( from carbonized paper or bamboo ) . early carbon filaments had a negative temperature coefficient of resistance — as they got hotter , their electrical resistance decreased . this made the lamp sensitive to fluctuations in the power supply , since a small increase of voltage would cause the filament to heat up , reducing its resistance and causing it to draw even more power and heat even further . in the " flashing " process , carbon filaments were heated by current passing through them while in an evacuated vessel containing hydrocarbon vapor ( usually gasoline ) . the carbon deposited on the filament by this treatment improved the uniformity and strength of filaments as well as their efficiency . a metallized or " graphitized " filament was first heated in a high-temperature oven before flashing and lamp assembly . this transformed the carbon into graphite which further strengthened and smoothed the filament . this also changed the filament to have a positive temperature coefficient , like a metallic conductor , and helped stabilize the lamp 's power consumption , temperature and light output against minor variations in supply voltage .

often categorised with the new wave of british heavy metal , in 1981 def leppard released their second album high 'n ' dry , mixing glam-rock with heavy metal , and helping to define the sound of hard rock for the decade . the follow-up pyromania ( 1983 ) , reached number two on the american charts and the singles " photograph " , " rock of ages " and " foolin ' " , helped by the emergence of mtv , all reached the top 40 . it was widely emulated , particularly by the emerging californian glam metal scene . this was followed by us acts like mötley crüe , with their albums too fast for love ( 1981 ) and shout at the devil ( 1983 ) and , as the style grew , the arrival of bands such as ratt , white lion , twisted sister and quiet riot . quiet riot 's album metal health ( 1983 ) was the first glam metal album , and arguably the first heavy metal album of any kind , to reach number one in the billboard music charts and helped open the doors for mainstream success by subsequent bands .
dell became the first company in the information technology industry to establish a product-recycling goal ( in 2004 ) and completed the implementation of its global consumer recycling-program in 2006 . on february 6 , 2007 , the national recycling coalition awarded dell its " recycling works " award for efforts to promote producer responsibility . on july 19 , 2007 , dell announced that it had exceeded targets in working to achieve a multi-year goal of recovering 275 million pounds of computer equipment by 2009 . the company reported the recovery of 78 million pounds ( nearly 40,000 tons ) of it equipment from customers in 2006 , a 93-percent increase over 2005 ; and 12.4 % of the equipment dell sold seven years earlier .
the 10th century saw a mass migration of turkic tribes from central asia into the iranian plateau . turkic tribesmen were first used in the abbasid army as mamluks ( slave-warriors ) , replacing iranian and arab elements within the army . as a result , the mamluks gained a significant political power . in 999 , large portions of iran came briefly under the rule of the ghaznavids , whose rulers were of mamluk turk origin , and longer subsequently under the turkish seljuk and khwarezmian empires . these turks had been persianized and had adopted persian models of administration and rulership . the seljuks subsequently gave rise to the sultanate of rum in anatolia , while taking their thoroughly persianized identity with them . the result of the adoption and patronage of persian culture by turkish rulers was the development of a distinct turko-persian tradition .
in 144 bc emperor jing abolished private minting in favor of central-government and commandery-level minting ; he also introduced a new coin . emperor wu introduced another in 120 bc , but a year later he abandoned the ban liangs entirely in favor of the wuzhu ( 五銖 ) coin , weighing 3.2 g ( 0.11 oz ) . the wuzhu became china 's standard coin until the tang dynasty ( 618–907 ad ) . its use was interrupted briefly by several new currencies introduced during wang mang 's regime until it was reinstated in 40 ad by emperor guangwu .
in addition to a spoken standard and a closely related written standard , czech has several regional dialects primarily used in rural areas by speakers less proficient in other dialects or standard czech . during the second half of the twentieth century , czech dialect use began to weaken . by the early 1990s dialect use was stigmatized , associated with the shrinking lower class and used in literature or other media for comedic effect . increased travel and media availability to dialect-speaking populations has encouraged them to shift to ( or add to their own dialect ) standard czech . although czech has received considerable scholarly interest for a slavic language , this interest has focused primarily on modern standard czech and ancient texts rather than dialects . standard czech is still the norm for politicians , businesspeople and other czechs in formal situations , but common czech is gaining ground in journalism and the mass media .
in the spring of 1834 , chopin attended the lower rhenish music festival in aix-la-chapelle with hiller , and it was there that chopin met felix mendelssohn . after the festival , the three visited düsseldorf , where mendelssohn had been appointed musical director . they spent what mendelssohn described as " a very agreeable day " , playing and discussing music at his piano , and met friedrich wilhelm schadow , director of the academy of art , and some of his eminent pupils such as lessing , bendemann , hildebrandt and sohn . in 1835 chopin went to carlsbad , where he spent time with his parents ; it was the last time he would see them . on his way back to paris , he met old friends from warsaw , the wodzińskis . he had made the acquaintance of their daughter maria in poland five years earlier , when she was eleven . this meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in dresden , when he had previously intended to return to paris via leipzig . the sixteen-year-old girl 's portrait of the composer is considered , along with delacroix 's , as among chopin 's best likenesses . in october he finally reached leipzig , where he met schumann , clara wieck and felix mendelssohn , who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio st. paul , and who considered him " a perfect musician " . in july 1836 chopin travelled to marienbad and dresden to be with the wodziński family , and in september he proposed to maria , whose mother countess wodzińska approved in principle . chopin went on to leipzig , where he presented schumann with his g minor ballade . at the end of 1836 he sent maria an album in which his sister ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs , and his 1835 nocturne in c-sharp minor , op . 27 , no . 1 . the anodyne thanks he received from maria proved to be the last letter he was to have from her .
during the later middle ages , theologians such as john duns scotus ( d. 1308 ) [ ah ] and william of ockham ( d. c. 1348 ) , led a reaction against scholasticism , objecting to the application of reason to faith . their efforts undermined the prevailing platonic idea of " universals " . ockham 's insistence that reason operates independently of faith allowed science to be separated from theology and philosophy . legal studies were marked by the steady advance of roman law into areas of jurisprudence previously governed by customary law . the lone exception to this trend was in england , where the common law remained pre-eminent . other countries codified their laws ; legal codes were promulgated in castile , poland , and lithuania .
in 1982 , regis mckenna was brought in to shape the marketing and launch of the macintosh . later the regis mckenna team grew to include jane anderson , katie cadigan and andy cunningham , who eventually led the apple account for the agency . cunningham and anderson were the primary authors of the macintosh launch plan . the launch of the macintosh pioneered many different tactics that are used today in launching technology products , including the " multiple exclusive , " event marketing ( credited to john sculley , who brought the concept over from pepsi ) , creating a mystique around a product and giving an inside look into a product 's creation .
in mid-1969 , idris travelled abroad to spend the summer in turkey and greece . gaddafi 's free officers recognized this as their chance to overthrow the monarchy , initiating " operation jerusalem " . on 1 september , they occupied airports , police depots , radio stations and government offices in tripoli and benghazi . gaddafi took control of the berka barracks in benghazi , while omar meheisha occupied tripoli barracks and jalloud seized the city 's anti-aircraft batteries . khweldi hameidi was sent to arrest crown prince sayyid hasan ar-rida al-mahdi as-sanussi , and force him to relinquish his claim to the throne . they met no serious resistance , and wielded little violence against the monarchists .
infrared tracking , also known as infrared homing , refers to a passive missile guidance system , which uses the emission from a target of electromagnetic radiation in the infrared part of the spectrum to track it . missiles that use infrared seeking are often referred to as " heat-seekers " , since infrared ( ir ) is just below the visible spectrum of light in frequency and is radiated strongly by hot bodies . many objects such as people , vehicle engines , and aircraft generate and retain heat , and as such , are especially visible in the infrared wavelengths of light compared to objects in the background .
during this time , link also helps midna find the fused shadows , fragments of a relic containing powerful dark magic . in return , she helps link find ordon village 's children while helping the monkeys of faron , the gorons of eldin , and the zoras of lanayru . once link has restored the light spirits and midna has all the fused shadows , they are ambushed by zant . after he relieves midna of the fused shadow fragments , she ridicules him for abusing his tribe 's magic , but zant reveals that his power comes from another source as he uses it to turn link back into a wolf , and then leaves midna in hyrule to die from the world 's light . bringing a dying midna to zelda , link learns he needs the master sword to return to human form . zelda sacrifices herself to heal midna with her power before vanishing mysteriously . midna is moved by zelda 's sacrifice , and begins to care more about link and the fate of the light world .
ganondorf then revives , and midna teleports link and zelda outside the castle so she can hold him off with the fused shadows . however , as hyrule castle collapses , it is revealed that ganondorf was victorious as he crushes midna 's helmet . ganondorf engages link on horseback , and , assisted by zelda and the light spirits , link eventually knocks ganondorf off his horse and they duel on foot before link strikes down ganondorf and plunges the master sword into his chest . with ganondorf dead , the light spirits not only bring midna back to life , but restore her to her true form . after bidding farewell to link and zelda , midna returns home before destroying the mirror of twilight with a tear to maintain balance between hyrule and the twilight realm . near the end , as hyrule castle is rebuilt , link is shown leaving ordon village heading to parts unknown .
traditionally , subspecies are seen as geographically isolated and genetically differentiated populations . that is , " the designation 'subspecies ' is used to indicate an objective degree of microevolutionary divergence " one objection to this idea is that it does not specify what degree of differentiation is required . therefore , any population that is somewhat biologically different could be considered a subspecies , even to the level of a local population . as a result , templeton has argued that it is necessary to impose a threshold on the level of difference that is required for a population to be designated a subspecies .
the szlachta ( [ ˈʂlaxta ] ( listen ) , exonym : nobility ) was a legally privileged noble class with origins in the kingdom of poland . it gained considerable institutional privileges between 1333 and 1370 during the reign of king casimir iii the great . :211 in 1413 , following a series of tentative personal unions between the grand duchy of lithuania and the crown kingdom of poland , the existing lithuanian nobility formally joined this class . :211 as the polish-lithuanian commonwealth ( 1569–1795 ) evolved and expanded in territory , its membership grew to include the leaders of ducal prussia , podolian and ruthenian lands .
tajikistan 's economy grew substantially after the war . the gdp of tajikistan expanded at an average rate of 9.6 % over the period of 2000–2007 according to the world bank data . this improved tajikistan 's position among other central asian countries ( namely turkmenistan and uzbekistan ) , which seem to have degraded economically ever since . the primary sources of income in tajikistan are aluminium production , cotton growing and remittances from migrant workers . cotton accounts for 60 % of agricultural output , supporting 75 % of the rural population , and using 45 % of irrigated arable land . the aluminium industry is represented by the state-owned tajik aluminum company – the biggest aluminium plant in central asia and one of the biggest in the world .
temperatures below 0 °c ( 32 °f ) or above 25 °c ( 77 °f ) are rare . cork airport records an average of 1,227.9 millimetres ( 4.029 ft ) of precipitation annually , most of which is rain . the airport records an average of 7 days of hail and 11 days of snow or sleet a year ; though it only records lying snow for 2 days of the year . the low altitude of the city , and moderating influences of the harbour , mean that lying snow very rarely occurs in the city itself . there are on average 204 " rainy " days a year ( over 0.2 millimetres ( 0.0079 in ) of rainfall ) , of which there are 73 days with " heavy rain " ( over 5 millimetres ( 0.20 in ) ) . cork is also a generally foggy city , with an average of 97 days of fog a year , most common during mornings and during winter . despite this , however , cork is also one of ireland 's sunniest cities , with an average of 3.9 hours of sunshine every day and only having 67 days where there is no " recordable sunshine " , mostly during and around winter .
the maya writing system ( often called hieroglyphs from a superficial resemblance to the ancient egyptian writing ) was a combination of phonetic symbols and logograms . it is most often classified as a logographic or ( more properly ) a logosyllabic writing system , in which syllabic signs play a significant role . it is the only pre-columbian writing system known to represent completely the spoken language of its community . in total , the script has more than one thousand different glyphs although a few are variations of the same sign or meaning and many appear only rarely or are confined to particular localities . at any one time , no more than about five hundred glyphs were in use , some two hundred of which ( including variations ) had a phonetic or syllabic interpretation .
occasionally a bisyllabic word is written with two characters that contain the same radical , as in 蝴蝶 húdié " butterfly " , where both characters have the insect radical 虫 . a notable example is pipa ( a chinese lute , also a fruit , the loquat , of similar shape ) – originally written as 批把 with the hand radical , referring to the down and up strokes when playing this instrument , which was then changed to 枇杷 ( tree radical ) , which is still used for the fruit , while the character was changed to 琵琶 when referring to the instrument . in other cases a compound word may coincidentally share a radical without this being meaningful .
pubs often have traditional names . a common name is the " marquis of granby " . these pubs were named after john manners , marquess of granby , who was the son of john manners , 3rd duke of rutland and a general in the 18th century british army . he showed a great concern for the welfare of his men , and on their retirement , provided funds for many of them to establish taverns , which were subsequently named after him . all pubs granted their licence in 1780 were called the royal george [ citation needed ] , after king george iii , and the twentieth anniversary of his coronation .
the story of the kelly gang , the world 's first feature film , was shot in melbourne in 1906 . melbourne filmmakers continued to produce bushranger films until they were banned by victorian politicians in 1912 for the perceived promotion of crime , thus contributing to the decline of one of the silent film era 's most productive industries . a notable film shot and set in melbourne during australia 's cinematic lull is on the beach ( 1959 ) . the 1970s saw the rise of the australian new wave and its ozploitation offshoot , instigated by melbourne-based productions stork and alvin purple . picnic at hanging rock and mad max , both shot in and around melbourne , achieved worldwide acclaim . 2004 saw the construction of melbourne 's largest film and television studio complex , docklands studios melbourne , which has hosted many domestic productions , as well as international features . melbourne is also home to the headquarters of village roadshow pictures , australia 's largest film production company . famous modern day actors from melbourne include cate blanchett , rachel griffiths , guy pearce , geoffrey rush and eric bana .
federalism is one of the entrenched constitutional principles of germany . according to the german constitution ( called grundgesetz or in english basic law ) , some topics , such as foreign affairs and defense , are the exclusive responsibility of the federation ( i.e. , the federal level ) , while others fall under the shared authority of the states and the federation ; the states retain residual legislative authority for all other areas , including " culture " , which in germany includes not only topics such as financial promotion of arts and sciences , but also most forms of education and job training . though international relations including international treaties are primarily the responsibility of the federal level , the constituent states have certain limited powers in this area : in matters that affect them directly , the states defend their interests at the federal level through the bundesrat ( literally federal council , the upper house of the german federal parliament ) and in areas where they have legislative authority they have limited powers to conclude international treaties " with the consent of the federal government " .
the soviet union duplicated its dual-launch feat with vostok 5 and vostok 6 ( june 16 , 1963 ) . this time they launched the first woman ( also the first civilian ) , valentina tereshkova , into space on vostok 6 . launching a woman was reportedly korolev 's idea , and it was accomplished purely for propaganda value . tereshkova was one of a small corps of female cosmonauts who were amateur parachutists , but tereshkova was the only one to fly . the ussr did n't again open its cosmonaut corps to women until 1980 , two years after the united states opened its astronaut corps to women .
on july 8 , 2007 the washington post published excerpts from ucla professor amy zegart 's book spying blind : the cia , the fbi , and the origins of 9/11 . the post reported from zegart 's book that government documents show the cia and fbi missed 23 potential chances to disrupt the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 . the primary reasons for the failures included : agency cultures resistant to change and new ideas ; inappropriate incentives for promotion ; and a lack of cooperation between the fbi , cia and the rest of the united states intelligence community . the book blamed the fbi 's decentralized structure , which prevented effective communication and cooperation among different fbi offices . the book suggested that the fbi has not evolved into an effective counter-terrorism or counter-intelligence agency , due in large part to deeply ingrained agency cultural resistance to change . for example , fbi personnel practices continue to treat all staff other than special agents as support staff , classifying intelligence analysts alongside the fbi 's auto mechanics and janitors .
androphilia and gynephilia ( or gynecophilia ) are terms used in behavioral science to describe sexual attraction , as an alternative to a homosexual and heterosexual conceptualization . they are used for identifying a subject 's object of attraction without attributing a sex assignment or gender identity to the subject . related terms such as pansexual and polysexual do not make any such assignations to the subject . people may also use terms such as queer , pansensual , polyfidelitous , ambisexual , or personalized identities such as byke or biphilic .
in 1838 the situation was slightly the same as in 1831 . muhammad ali of egypt was not happy about lack of his control and power in syria , he resumed military actions . the ottoman army lost to egyptians at the battle of nezib on june 24 , 1839 . the ottoman empire was saved by great britain , austria , prussia and russia by signing a convention in london in july 15 , 1840 to grant muhammad ali and his descendants the right to inherit power in egypt in exchange for removal of egyptian military forces from syria and lebanon . moreover , muhammad ali had to admit a formal dependence from the ottoman sultan . after muhammad ali refused to obey the requirements of the london convention , the allied anglo-austrian fleet blocked the delta , bombarded beirut and captured acre . muhammad ali accepted the conditions of the london convention in 1840 .
in 1985 , spielberg released the color purple , an adaptation of alice walker 's pulitzer prize-winning novel of the same name , about a generation of empowered african-american women during depression-era america . starring whoopi goldberg and future talk-show superstar oprah winfrey , the film was a box office smash and critics hailed spielberg 's successful foray into the dramatic genre . roger ebert proclaimed it the best film of the year and later entered it into his great films archive . the film received eleven academy award nominations , including two for goldberg and winfrey . however , much to the surprise of many , spielberg did not get a best director nomination .
areas that should not be soldered may be covered with solder resist ( solder mask ) . one of the most common solder resists used today is called " lpi " ( liquid photoimageable solder mask ) . a photo-sensitive coating is applied to the surface of the pwb , then exposed to light through the solder mask image film , and finally developed where the unexposed areas are washed away . dry film solder mask is similar to the dry film used to image the pwb for plating or etching . after being laminated to the pwb surface it is imaged and develop as lpi . once common but no longer commonly used because of its low accuracy and resolution is to screen print epoxy ink . solder resist also provides protection from the environment .
the pacific war saw the allied powers pitted against the empire of japan , the latter briefly aided by thailand and to a much lesser extent by its axis allies , germany and italy . the war culminated in the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki , and other large aerial bomb attacks by the united states army air forces , accompanied by the soviet invasion of manchuria on 8 august 1945 , resulting in the japanese announcement of intent to surrender on 15 august 1945 . the formal and official surrender of japan took place aboard the battleship uss missouri in tokyo bay on 2 september 1945 . following its defeat , japan 's shinto emperor stepped down as the divine leader through the shinto directive , because the allied powers believed this was the major political cause of japan 's military aggression and deconstruction process soon took place to install a new liberal-democratic constitution to the japanese public as the current constitution of japan .
despite the commanded withdrawal of egyptian troops , about 2,000 egyptian soldiers were killed during engagement with israeli forces , and some 5,000 egyptian soldiers were captured by the israeli army . amer and salah salem proposed requesting a ceasefire , with salem further recommending that nasser surrender himself to british forces . nasser berated amer and salem , and vowed , " nobody is going to surrender . " nasser assumed military command . despite the relative ease in which sinai was occupied , nasser 's prestige at home and among arabs was undamaged . to counterbalance the egyptian army 's dismal performance , nasser authorized the distribution of about 400,000 rifles to civilian volunteers and hundreds of militias were formed throughout egypt , many led by nasser 's political opponents .
the only cosmetic difference between an rlv disc and a regular factory-pressed laserdiscs is their reflective purple-violet ( or blue with some rlv discs ) color resulting from the dye embedded in the reflective layer of the disc to make it recordable , as opposed to the silver mirror appearance of regular lds . the purplish color of rlvs is very similar to dvd-r and dvd+r discs . rlvs were popular for making short-run quantities of laserdiscs for specialized applications such as interactive kiosks and flight simulators .
moreover , a conflict of interest between professional investment managers and their institutional clients , combined with a global glut in investment capital , led to bad investments by asset managers in over-priced credit assets . professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client assets under management . there is , therefore , an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation . as the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline , asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients . many asset managers chose to continue to invest client funds in over-priced ( under-yielding ) investments , to the detriment of their clients , in order to maintain their assets under management . this choice was supported by a " plausible deniability " of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early " vintages " of subprime loans was so low .
on september 22 , 1980 , the iraqi army invaded the iranian khuzestan , and the iran–iraq war began . although the forces of saddam hussein made several early advances , by mid 1982 , the iranian forces successfully managed to drive the iraqi army back into iraq . in july 1982 , with iraq thrown on the defensive , iran took the decision to invade iraq and conducted countless offensives in a bid to conquer iraqi territory and capture cities , such as basra . the war continued until 1988 , when the iraqi army defeated the iranian forces inside iraq and pushed the remaining iranian troops back across the border . subsequently , khomeini accepted a truce mediated by the un . the total iranian casualties in the war were estimated to be 123,220–160,000 kia , 60,711 mia , and 11,000–16,000 civilians killed .
the original post-punk movement ended as the bands associated with the movement turned away from its aesthetics , often in favor of more commercial sounds . many of these groups would continue recording as part of the new pop movement , with entryism becoming a popular concept . in the united states , driven by mtv and modern rock radio stations , a number of post-punk acts had an influence on or became part of the second british invasion of " new music " there . some shifted to a more commercial new wave sound ( such as gang of four ) , while others were fixtures on american college radio and became early examples of alternative rock . perhaps the most successful band to emerge from post-punk was u2 , who combined elements of religious imagery together with political commentary into their often anthemic music .
in the view of many associated with the radical reformation , the magisterial reformation had not gone far enough . radical reformer , andreas von bodenstein karlstadt , for example , referred to the lutheran theologians at wittenberg as the " new papists " . since the term " magister " also means " teacher " , the magisterial reformation is also characterized by an emphasis on the authority of a teacher . this is made evident in the prominence of luther , calvin , and zwingli as leaders of the reform movements in their respective areas of ministry . because of their authority , they were often criticized by radical reformers as being too much like the roman popes . a more political side of the radical reformation can be seen in the thought and practice of hans hut , although typically anabaptism has been associated with pacifism .
during the 1890s , the armenian revolutionary federation , commonly known as dashnaktsutyun , became active within the ottoman empire with the aim of unifying the various small groups in the empire that were advocating for reform and defending armenian villages from massacres that were widespread in some of the armenian-populated areas of the empire . dashnaktsutyun members also formed fedayi groups that defended armenian civilians through armed resistance . the dashnaks also worked for the wider goal of creating a " free , independent and unified " armenia , although they sometimes set aside this goal in favor of a more realistic approach , such as advocating autonomy .
the troops were reembarked and moved to the bay of st. lunaire in brittany where , on 3 september , they were landed to operate against st. malo ; however , this action proved impractical . worsening weather forced the two armies to separate : the ships sailed for the safer anchorage of st . cast , while the army proceeded overland . the tardiness of bligh in moving his forces allowed a french force of 10,000 from brest to catch up with him and open fire on the reembarkation troops . a rear-guard of 1,400 under general dury held off the french while the rest of the army embarked . they could not be saved ; 750 , including dury , were killed and the rest captured .
mandolin has also been used in blues music , most notably by ry cooder , who performed outstanding covers on his very first recordings , yank rachell , johnny " man " young , carl martin , and gerry hundt . howard armstrong , who is famous for blues violin , got his start with his father 's mandolin and played in string bands similar to the other tennessee string bands he came into contact with , with band makeup including " mandolins and fiddles and guitars and banjos . and once in a while they would ease a little ukulele in there and a bass fiddle . " other blues players from the era 's string bands include willie black ( whistler and his jug band ) , dink brister , jim hill , charles johnson , coley jones ( dallas string band ) , bobby leecan ( need more band ) , alfred martin , charlie mccoy ( 1909-1950 ) , al miller , matthew prater , and herb quinn .
on october 28 , 2015 , ibm announced its acquisition of digital assets from the weather company—a holding company of bain capital , the blackstone group and nbcuniversal which owns the weather channel , including its weather data platforms ( such as weather services international ) , websites ( weather.com and weather underground ) and mobile apps . the acquisition seeks to use watson for weather analytics and predictions . the acquisition does not include the weather channel itself , which will enter into a long-term licensing agreement with ibm for use of its data . the sale closed on january 29 , 2016
a hdi of 0.8 or more is considered to represent " high development " . this includes all developed countries , such as those in north america , western europe , oceania , and eastern asia , as well as some developing countries in eastern europe , central and south america , southeast asia , the caribbean , and the oil-rich arabian peninsula . seven countries were promoted to this category this year , leaving the " medium development " group : albania , belarus , brazil , libya , macedonia , russia and saudi arabia .
the beijing olympic organizing committee sent out a team of 30 unarmed attendants selected from the people 's armed police to escort the flame throughout its journey . according to asian times , sworn in as the " beijing olympic games sacred flame protection unit " during a ceremony in august 2007 , their main job is to keep the olympic flame alight throughout the journey and to assist in transferring the flame between the torches , the lanterns and the cauldrons . they wear matching blue tracksuits and are intended to accompany the torch every step of the way . one of the torch attendants , dubbed " second right brother , " has developed a significant online fan-base , particularly among china 's female netizens .
inner and outer vestibules lead to the octagonal chapter house , which is of exceptional architectural purity . it is built in a geometrical gothic style with an octagonal crypt below . a pier of eight shafts carries the vaulted ceiling . to the sides are blind arcading , remains of 14th-century paintings and numerous stone benches above which are innovatory large 4-light quatre-foiled windows . these are virtually contemporary with the sainte-chapelle , paris .
the fauna in the state is just as diverse as the flora and varies greatly due to the large contrast in climates . in the mountain zone of the state the most observed mammals are : mexican fox squirrel ( sciurus nayaritensis ) , antelope jackrabbit ( lepus alleni ) , raccoon ( procyon lotor ) , hooded skunk ( mephitis macroura ) , wild boar ( sus scrofa ) , collared peccary ( pecari tajacu ) , white-tailed deer ( odocoileus virginianus ) , mule deer odocoileus hemionus , american bison bison bison , cougar ( puma concolor ) , eastern cottontail sylvilagus floridanus , north american porcupine erethizon dorsatum , bobcat lynx rufus , mexican wolf canis lupus baileyi , and coyote canis latrans . american black bear ursus americanus is also found but in very small numbers . the mexican wolf , once abundant , has been extirpated . the main cause of degradation has been grazing . although there are many reptilian species in the mountains the most observed species include : northern mexican pine snake , pituophis deppei jani , texas horned lizard ( phrynosoma cornutum ) , rock rattlesnake ( crotalus lepidus ) , black-tailed rattlesnake ( crotalus molossus ) , and plateau tiger salamander ambystoma velasci , one of possibly many amphibians to be found in the mountains .
during the early years , mca also manufactured discs for other companies including paramount , disney and warner bros . some of them added their own names to the disc jacket to signify that the movie was not owned by mca . after discovision associates shut down in early 1982 , universal studio 's videodisc software label , called mca videodisc until 1984 , began reissuing many discovision titles . unfortunately , quite a few , such as battlestar galactica and jaws , were time-compressed versions of their cav or clv disco vision originals . the time-compressed clv re-issue of jaws no longer had the original soundtrack , having had incidental background music replaced for the video disc version due to licensing cost ( the music would not be available until the thx laserdisc box set was released in 1995 ) . one universal/columbia co-production issued by mca disco vision in both cav and clv versions , the electric horseman , is still not available in any other home video format with its original score intact ; even the most recent dvd release has had substantial music replacements of both instrumental score and willie nelson 's songs . an mca release of universal 's howard the duck , sees only the start credits shown in widescreen before changing to 4:3 for the rest of the film . for many years this was the only disc-based release of the film , until widescreen dvd formats were released with extras . also , the laserdisc release of e.t . the extra-terrestrial is the only format to include the cut scene of harrison ford playing the part of the school headmaster telling off elliott for letting the frogs free in the biology class .
many causes for the financial crisis have been suggested , with varying weight assigned by experts . the u.s. senate 's levin–coburn report concluded that the crisis was the result of " high risk , complex financial products ; undisclosed conflicts of interest ; the failure of regulators , the credit rating agencies , and the market itself to rein in the excesses of wall street . " the financial crisis inquiry commission concluded that the financial crisis was avoidable and was caused by " widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision " , " dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management at many systemically important financial institutions " , " a combination of excessive borrowing , risky investments , and lack of transparency " by financial institutions , ill preparation and inconsistent action by government that " added to the uncertainty and panic " , a " systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics " , " collapsing mortgage-lending standards and the mortgage securitization pipeline " , deregulation of over-the-counter derivatives , especially credit default swaps , and " the failures of credit rating agencies " to correctly price risk . the 1999 repeal of the glass-steagall act effectively removed the separation between investment banks and depository banks in the united states . critics argued that credit rating agencies and investors failed to accurately price the risk involved with mortgage-related financial products , and that governments did not adjust their regulatory practices to address 21st-century financial markets . research into the causes of the financial crisis has also focused on the role of interest rate spreads .
despite being an original story , spectre draws on ian fleming 's source material , most notably in the character of franz oberhauser , played by christoph waltz . oberhauser shares his name with hannes oberhauser , a background character in the short story " octopussy " from the octopussy and the living daylights collection , and who is named in the film as having been a temporary legal guardian of a young bond in 1983 . similarly , charmian bond is shown to have been his full-time guardian , observing the back story established by fleming . with the acquisition of the rights to spectre and its associated characters , screenwriters neal purvis and robert wade revealed that the film would provide a minor retcon to the continuity of the previous films , with the quantum organisation alluded to in casino royale and introduced in quantum of solace reimagined as a division within spectre rather than an independent organisation .
oklahoma i/ˌoʊkləˈhoʊmə/ ( cherokee : asgaya gigageyi / ᎠᏍᎦᏯ ᎩᎦᎨᏱ ; or translated ᎣᎦᎳᎰᎹ ( òɡàlàhoma ) , pawnee : uukuhuúwa , cayuga : gahnawiyoˀgeh ) is a state located in the south central united states . oklahoma is the 20th most extensive and the 28th most populous of the 50 united states . the state 's name is derived from the choctaw words okla and humma , meaning " red people " . it is also known informally by its nickname , the sooner state , in reference to the non-native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land before the official opening date , and the indian appropriations act of 1889 , which opened the door for white settlement in america 's indian territory . the name was settled upon statehood , oklahoma territory and indian territory were merged and indian was dropped from the name . on november 16 , 1907 , oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union . its residents are known as oklahomans , or informally " okies " , and its capital and largest city is oklahoma city .
the 21 nocturnes are more structured , and of greater emotional depth , than those of field ( whom chopin met in 1833 ) . many of the chopin nocturnes have middle sections marked by agitated expression ( and often making very difficult demands on the performer ) which heightens their dramatic character .
the mildred lane kemper art museum , established in 1881 , is one of the oldest teaching museums in the country . the collection includes works from 19th , 20th , and 21st century american and european artists , including george caleb bingham , thomas cole , pablo picasso , max ernst , alexander calder , jackson pollock , rembrandt , robert rauschenberg , barbara kruger , and christian boltanski . also in the complex is the 3,000 sq ft ( 300 m2 ) newman money museum . in october 2006 , the kemper art museum moved from its previous location , steinberg hall , into a new facility designed by former faculty member fumihiko maki . interestingly , the new kemper art museum is located directly across from steinberg hall , which was maki 's very first commission in 1959 .
historians disagree on what the relationship was between the ming court and tibet and whether or not ming china had sovereignty over tibet . van praag writes that chinese court historians viewed tibet as an independent foreign tributary and had little interest in tibet besides a lama-patron relationship . the historian tsepon w. d. shakabpa supports van praag 's position . however , wang jiawei and nyima gyaincain state that these assertions by van praag and shakabpa are " fallacies " .
beyoncé participated in george clooney and wyclef jean 's hope for haiti now : a global benefit for earthquake relief telethon and was named the official face of the limited edition cfda " fashion for haiti " t-shirt , made by theory which raised a total of $ 1 million . on march 5 , 2010 , beyoncé and her mother tina opened the beyoncé cosmetology center at the brooklyn phoenix house , offering a seven-month cosmetology training course for men and women . in april 2011 , beyoncé joined forces with us first lady michelle obama and the national association of broadcasters education foundation , to help boost the latter 's campaign against child obesity by reworking her single " get me bodied " . following the death of osama bin laden , beyoncé released her cover of the lee greenwood song " god bless the usa " , as a charity single to help raise funds for the new york police and fire widows ' and children 's benefit fund .

the majority of paris ' salaried employees fill 370,000 businesses services jobs , concentrated in the north-western 8th , 16th and 17th arrondissements . paris ' financial service companies are concentrated in the central-western 8th and 9th arrondissement banking and insurance district . paris ' department store district in the 1st , 6th , 8th and 9th arrondissements employ 10 percent of mostly female paris workers , with 100,000 of these registered in the retail trade . fourteen percent of parisians work in hotels and restaurants and other services to individuals . nineteen percent of paris employees work for the state in either in administration or education . the majority of paris ' healthcare and social workers work at the hospitals and social housing concentrated in the peripheral 13th , 14th , 18th , 19th and 20th arrondissements . outside paris , the western hauts-de-seine department la défense district specialising in finance , insurance and scientific research district , employs 144,600 , and the north-eastern seine-saint-denis audiovisual sector has 200 media firms and 10 major film studios .
romanesque architecture in germany , poland , the czech lands and austria is characterised by its massive and modular nature . this is expressed in the gothic architecture of central europe in the huge size of the towers and spires , often projected , but not always completed . the west front generally follows the french formula , but the towers are very much taller and , if complete , are surmounted by enormous openwork spires that are a regional feature . because of the size of the towers , the section of the façade between them may appear narrow and compressed . the eastern end follows the french form . the distinctive character of the interior of german gothic cathedrals is their breadth and openness . this is the case even when , as at cologne , they have been modelled upon a french cathedral . german cathedrals , like the french , tend not to have strongly projecting transepts . there are also many hall churches ( hallenkirchen ) without clerestory windows .
the spiritual tradition of dominic 's order is punctuated not only by charity , study and preaching , but also by instances of mystical union . the dominican emphasis on learning and on charity distinguishes it from other monastic and mendicant orders . as the order first developed on the european continent , learning continued to be emphasized by these friars and their sisters in christ . these religious also struggled for a deeply personal , intimate relationship with god . when the order reached england , many of these attributes were kept , but the english gave the order additional , specialized characteristics . this topic is discussed below .
the company , which benefited from the imperial patronage , soon expanded its commercial trading operations , eclipsing the portuguese estado da índia , which had established bases in goa , chittagong , and bombay , which portugal later ceded to england as part of the dowry of catherine de braganza . the east india company also launched a joint attack with the dutch united east india company on portuguese and spanish ships off the coast of china , which helped secure their ports in china . the company established trading posts in surat ( 1619 ) , madras ( 1639 ) , bombay ( 1668 ) , and calcutta ( 1690 ) . by 1647 , the company had 23 factories , each under the command of a factor or master merchant and governor if so chosen , and 90 employees in india . the major factories became the walled forts of fort william in bengal , fort st george in madras , and bombay castle .
although the city lost the status of state capital to columbia in 1786 , charleston became even more prosperous in the plantation-dominated economy of the post-revolutionary years . the invention of the cotton gin in 1793 revolutionized the processing of this crop , making short-staple cotton profitable . it was more easily grown in the upland areas , and cotton quickly became south carolina 's major export commodity . the piedmont region was developed into cotton plantations , to which the sea islands and lowcountry were already devoted . slaves were also the primary labor force within the city , working as domestics , artisans , market workers , and laborers .
sacrifice to deities of the heavens ( di superi , " gods above " ) was performed in daylight , and under the public gaze . deities of the upper heavens required white , infertile victims of their own sex : juno a white heifer ( possibly a white cow ) ; jupiter a white , castrated ox ( bos mas ) for the annual oath-taking by the consuls . di superi with strong connections to the earth , such as mars , janus , neptune and various genii – including the emperor 's – were offered fertile victims . after the sacrifice , a banquet was held ; in state cults , the images of honoured deities took pride of place on banqueting couches and by means of the sacrificial fire consumed their proper portion ( exta , the innards ) . rome 's officials and priests reclined in order of precedence alongside and ate the meat ; lesser citizens may have had to provide their own .
paul vi was the first pope to receive an anglican archbishop of canterbury , michael ramsey in official audience as head of church , after the private audience visit of archbishop geoffrey fisher to pope john xxiii on 2 december 1960 . ramsey met paul three times during his visit and opened the anglican centre in rome to increase their mutual knowledge . he praised paul vi [ e ] and his contributions in the service of unity . paul replied that " by entering into our house , you are entering your own house , we are happy to open our door and heart to you . " the two church leaders signed a common declaration , which put an end to the disputes of the past and outlined a common agenda for the future .

sanskrit , as defined by pāṇini , evolved out of the earlier vedic form . the present form of vedic sanskrit can be traced back to as early as the second millennium bce ( for rig-vedic ) . scholars often distinguish vedic sanskrit and classical or " pāṇinian " sanskrit as separate dialects . though they are quite similar , they differ in a number of essential points of phonology , vocabulary , grammar and syntax . vedic sanskrit is the language of the vedas , a large collection of hymns , incantations ( samhitas ) and theological and religio-philosophical discussions in the brahmanas and upanishads . modern linguists consider the metrical hymns of the rigveda samhita to be the earliest , composed by many authors over several centuries of oral tradition . the end of the vedic period is marked by the composition of the upanishads , which form the concluding part of the traditional vedic corpus ; however , the early sutras are vedic , too , both in language and content .

hydrogen forms a vast array of compounds with carbon called the hydrocarbons , and an even vaster array with heteroatoms that , because of their general association with living things , are called organic compounds . the study of their properties is known as organic chemistry and their study in the context of living organisms is known as biochemistry . by some definitions , " organic " compounds are only required to contain carbon . however , most of them also contain hydrogen , and because it is the carbon-hydrogen bond which gives this class of compounds most of its particular chemical characteristics , carbon-hydrogen bonds are required in some definitions of the word " organic " in chemistry . millions of hydrocarbons are known , and they are usually formed by complicated synthetic pathways , which seldom involve elementary hydrogen .

the migrations and invasions of the 4th and 5th centuries disrupted trade networks around the mediterranean . african goods stopped being imported into europe , first disappearing from the interior and by the 7th century found only in a few cities such as rome or naples . by the end of the 7th century , under the impact of the muslim conquests , african products were no longer found in western europe . the replacement of goods from long-range trade with local products was a trend throughout the old roman lands that happened in the early middle ages . this was especially marked in the lands that did not lie on the mediterranean , such as northern gaul or britain . non-local goods appearing in the archaeological record are usually luxury goods . in the northern parts of europe , not only were the trade networks local , but the goods carried were simple , with little pottery or other complex products . around the mediterranean , pottery remained prevalent and appears to have been traded over medium-range networks , not just produced locally .

ucla professor richard h. sander published an article in the november 2004 issue of the stanford law review that questioned the effectiveness of racial preferences in law schools . he noted that , prior to his article , there had been no comprehensive study on the effects of affirmative action . the article presents a study that shows that half of all black law students rank near the bottom of their class after the first year of law school and that black law students are more likely to drop out of law school and to fail the bar exam . the article offers a tentative estimate that the production of new black lawyers in the united states would grow by eight percent if affirmative action programs at all law schools were ended . less qualified black students would attend less prestigious schools where they would be more closely matched in abilities with their classmates and thus perform relatively better . sander helped to develop a socioeconomically-based affirmative action plan for the ucla school of law after the passage of proposition 209 in 1996 , which prohibited the use of racial preferences by public universities in california . this change occurred after studies showed that the graduation rate of blacks at ucla was 41 % , compared to 73 % for whites .
napoleon 's educational reforms laid the foundation of a modern system of education in france and throughout much of europe . napoleon synthesized the best academic elements from the ancien régime , the enlightenment , and the revolution , with the aim of establishing a stable , well-educated and prosperous society . he made french the only official language . he left some primary education in the hands of religious orders , but he offered public support to secondary education . napoleon founded a number of state secondary schools ( lycées ) designed to produce a standardized education that was uniform across france . all students were taught the sciences along with modern and classical languages . unlike the system during the ancien régime , religious topics did not dominate the curriculum , although they were present in addition to teachers from the clergy . napoleon simply hoped to use religion to produce social stability . he gave special attention to the advanced centers , notably the école polytechnique , that provided both military expertise and state-of-the-art research in science . napoleon made some of the first major efforts at establishing a system of secular and public education . the system featured scholarships and strict discipline , with the result being a french educational system that outperformed its european counterparts , many of which borrowed from the french system .
feynman has been called the " great explainer " . he gained a reputation for taking great care when giving explanations to his students and for making it a moral duty to make the topic accessible . his guiding principle was that , if a topic could not be explained in a freshman lecture , it was not yet fully understood . feynman gained great pleasure from coming up with such a " freshman-level " explanation , for example , of the connection between spin and statistics . what he said was that groups of particles with spin ½ " repel " , whereas groups with integer spin " clump " . this was a brilliantly simplified way of demonstrating how fermi–dirac statistics and bose–einstein statistics evolved as a consequence of studying how fermions and bosons behave under a rotation of 360° . this was also a question he pondered in his more advanced lectures , and to which he demonstrated the solution in the 1986 dirac memorial lecture . in the same lecture , he further explained that antiparticles must exist , for if particles had only positive energies , they would not be restricted to a so-called " light cone " .
exclusive jurisdiction is a concept whereby only one grand lodge will be recognised in any geographical area . if two grand lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area , the other grand lodges will have to choose between them , and they may not all decide to recognise the same one . ( in 1849 , for example , the grand lodge of new york split into two rival factions , each claiming to be the legitimate grand lodge . other grand lodges had to choose between them until the schism was healed . ) exclusive jurisdiction can be waived when the two over-lapping grand lodges are themselves in amity and agree to share jurisdiction ( for example , since the grand lodge of connecticut is in amity with the prince hall grand lodge of connecticut , the principle of exclusive jurisdiction does not apply , and other grand lodges may recognise both ) .
as the ottoman empire gradually shrank in size , some 7–9 million turkish-muslims from its former territories in the caucasus , crimea , balkans , and the mediterranean islands migrated to anatolia and eastern thrace . after the empire lost the balkan wars ( 1912–13 ) , it lost all its balkan territories except east thrace ( european turkey ) . this resulted in around 400,000 muslims fleeing with the retreating ottoman armies ( with many dying from cholera brought by the soldiers ) , and with some 400,000 non-muslims fleeing territory still under ottoman rule . justin mccarthy estimates that during the period 1821 to 1922 several million muslims died in the balkans , with the expulsion of a similar number .

frederick saw saxony and polish west prussia as potential fields for expansion but could not expect french support if he started an aggressive war for them . if he joined the french against the british in the hope of annexing hanover , he might fall victim to an austro-russian attack . the hereditary elector of saxony , augustus iii , was also elective king of poland as augustus iii , but the two territories were physically separated by brandenburg and silesia . neither state could pose as a great power . saxony was merely a buffer between prussia and austrian bohemia , whereas poland , despite its union with the ancient lands of lithuania , was prey to pro-french and pro-russian factions . a prussian scheme for compensating frederick augustus with bohemia in exchange for saxony obviously presupposed further spoliation of austria .
both rousseau and locke 's social contract theories rest on the presupposition of natural rights , which are not a result of law or custom , but are things that all men have in pre-political societies , and are therefore universal and inalienable . the most famous natural right formulation comes from john locke in his second treatise , when he introduces the state of nature . for locke the law of nature is grounded on mutual security , or the idea that one can not infringe on another 's natural rights , as every man is equal and has the same inalienable rights . these natural rights include perfect equality and freedom , and the right to preserve life and property . locke also argued against slavery on the basis that enslaving yourself goes against the law of nature ; you can not surrender your own rights , your freedom is absolute and no one can take it from you . additionally , locke argues that one person can not enslave another because it is morally reprehensible , although he introduces a caveat by saying that enslavement of a lawful captive in time of war would not go against one 's natural rights .

thus , in less than twenty years , rome had destroyed the power of one of the successor states , crippled another , and firmly entrenched its influence over greece . this was primarily a result of the over-ambition of the macedonian kings , and their unintended provocation of rome ; though rome was quick to exploit the situation . in another twenty years , the macedonian kingdom was no more . seeking to re-assert macedonian power and greek independence , philip v 's son perseus incurred the wrath of the romans , resulting in the third macedonian war ( 171–168 bc ) . victorious , the romans abolished the macedonian kingdom , replacing it with four puppet republics ; these lasted a further twenty years before macedon was formally annexed as a roman province ( 146 bc ) after yet another rebellion under andriscus . rome now demanded that the achaean league , the last stronghold of greek independence , be dissolved . the achaeans refused and declared war on rome . most of the greek cities rallied to the achaeans ' side , even slaves were freed to fight for greek independence . the roman consul lucius mummius advanced from macedonia and defeated the greeks at corinth , which was razed to the ground . in 146 bc , the greek peninsula , though not the islands , became a roman protectorate . roman taxes were imposed , except in athens and sparta , and all the cities had to accept rule by rome 's local allies .

in november 2008 , economist dean baker observed : " there is a really good reason for tighter credit . tens of millions of homeowners who had substantial equity in their homes two years ago have little or nothing today . businesses are facing the worst downturn since the great depression . this matters for credit decisions . a homeowner with equity in her home is very unlikely to default on a car loan or credit card debt . they will draw on this equity rather than lose their car and/or have a default placed on their credit record . on the other hand , a homeowner who has no equity is a serious default risk . in the case of businesses , their creditworthiness depends on their future profits . profit prospects look much worse in november 2008 than they did in november 2007 ... while many banks are obviously at the brink , consumers and businesses would be facing a much harder time getting credit right now even if the financial system were rock solid . the problem with the economy is the loss of close to $ 6 trillion in housing wealth and an even larger amount of stock wealth .

switzerland lies between latitudes 45° and 48° n , and longitudes 5° and 11° e. it contains three basic topographical areas : the swiss alps to the south , the swiss plateau or central plateau , and the jura mountains on the west . the alps are a high mountain range running across the central-south of the country , comprising about 60 % of the country 's total area . the majority of the swiss population live in the swiss plateau . among the high valleys of the swiss alps many glaciers are found , totalling an area of 1,063 square kilometres ( 410 sq mi ) . from these originate the headwaters of several major rivers , such as the rhine , inn , ticino and rhône , which flow in the four cardinal directions into the whole of europe . the hydrographic network includes several of the largest bodies of freshwater in central and western europe , among which are included lake geneva ( also called le lac léman in french ) , lake constance ( known as bodensee in german ) and lake maggiore . switzerland has more than 1500 lakes , and contains 6 % of europe 's stock of fresh water . lakes and glaciers cover about 6 % of the national territory . the largest lake is lake geneva , in western switzerland shared with france . the rhône is both the main source and outflow of lake geneva . lake constance is the second largest swiss lake and , like the lake geneva , an intermediate step by the rhine at the border to austria and germany . while the rhône flows into the mediterranean sea at the french camarque region and the rhine flows into the north sea at rotterdam in the netherlands , about 1000 km apart , both springs are only about 22 km apart from each other in the swiss alps .
cultural depictions of dogs in art extend back thousands of years to when dogs were portrayed on the walls of caves . representations of dogs became more elaborate as individual breeds evolved and the relationships between human and canine developed . hunting scenes were popular in the middle ages and the renaissance . dogs were depicted to symbolize guidance , protection , loyalty , fidelity , faithfulness , watchfulness , and love .
in 1926 joseph p. maxwell and henry c. harrison from bell telephone laboratories disclosed that the recording pattern of the western electric " rubber line " magnetic disc cutter had a constant velocity characteristic . this meant that as frequency increased in the treble , recording amplitude decreased . conversely , in the bass as frequency decreased , recording amplitude increased . therefore , it was necessary to attenuate the bass frequencies below about 250 hz , the bass turnover point , in the amplified microphone signal fed to the recording head . otherwise , bass modulation became excessive and overcutting took place into the next record groove . when played back electrically with a magnetic pickup having a smooth response in the bass region , a complementary boost in amplitude at the bass turnover point was necessary . g. h. miller in 1934 reported that when complementary boost at the turnover point was used in radio broadcasts of records , the reproduction was more realistic and many of the musical instruments stood out in their true form .
by 1878 , because of the growing popularity of the city , one railroad line could no longer keep up with demand . soon , the philadelphia and atlantic city railway was also constructed to transport tourists to atlantic city . at this point massive hotels like the united states and surf house , as well as smaller rooming houses , had sprung up all over town . the united states hotel took up a full city block between atlantic , pacific , delaware , and maryland avenues . these hotels were not only impressive in size , but featured the most updated amenities , and were considered quite luxurious for their time .
each republican magistrate held certain constitutional powers . only the people of rome ( both plebeians and patricians ) had the right to confer these powers on any individual magistrate . the most powerful constitutional power was imperium . imperium was held by both consuls and praetors . imperium gave a magistrate the authority to command a military force . all magistrates also had the power of coercion . this was used by magistrates to maintain public order . while in rome , all citizens had a judgement against coercion . this protection was called provocatio ( see below ) . magistrates also had both the power and the duty to look for omens . this power would often be used to obstruct political opponents .
the wine and beerhouse act 1869 reintroduced the stricter controls of the previous century . the sale of beers , wines or spirits required a licence for the premises from the local magistrates . further provisions regulated gaming , drunkenness , prostitution and undesirable conduct on licensed premises , enforceable by prosecution or more effectively by the landlord under threat of forfeiting his licence . licences were only granted , transferred or renewed at special licensing sessions courts , and were limited to respectable individuals . often these were ex-servicemen or ex-policemen ; retiring to run a pub was popular amongst military officers at the end of their service . licence conditions varied widely , according to local practice . they would specify permitted hours , which might require sunday closing , or conversely permit all-night opening near a market . typically they might require opening throughout the permitted hours , and the provision of food or lavatories . once obtained , licences were jealously protected by the licensees ( who were expected to be generally present , not an absentee owner or company ) , and even " occasional licences " to serve drinks at temporary premises such as fêtes would usually be granted only to existing licensees . objections might be made by the police , rival landlords or anyone else on the grounds of infractions such as serving drunks , disorderly or dirty premises , or ignoring permitted hours .
about 40,000,000 tons were produced in 1984 [ needs update ] . it is obtained as the " heavy " ( i.e. , difficult to distill ) fraction . material with a boiling point greater than around 500 °c is considered asphalt . vacuum distillation separates it from the other components in crude oil ( such as naphtha , gasoline and diesel ) . the resulting material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the properties of the material to suit applications . in a de-asphalting unit , the crude asphalt is treated with either propane or butane in a supercritical phase to extract the lighter molecules , which are then separated . further processing is possible by " blowing " the product : namely reacting it with oxygen . this step makes the product harder and more viscous .
despite their descent from wolves and classification as carnivora , dogs are variously described in scholarly and other writings as carnivores or omnivores . unlike obligate carnivores , such as the cat family with its shorter small intestine , dogs can adapt to a wide-ranging diet , and are not dependent on meat-specific protein nor a very high level of protein in order to fulfill their basic dietary requirements . dogs will healthily digest a variety of foods , including vegetables and grains , and can consume a large proportion of these in their diet . comparing dogs and wolves , dogs have adaptations in genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet .
in 1992 , an alabama editorial called for the death of atticus , saying that as liberal as atticus was , he still worked within a system of institutionalized racism and sexism and should not be revered . the editorial sparked a flurry of responses from attorneys who entered the profession because of him and esteemed him as a hero . critics of atticus maintain he is morally ambiguous and does not use his legal skills to challenge the racist status quo in maycomb . however , in 1997 , the alabama state bar erected a monument to atticus in monroeville , marking his existence as the " first commemorative milestone in the state 's judicial history " . in 2008 , lee herself received an honorary special membership to the alabama state bar for creating atticus who " has become the personification of the exemplary lawyer in serving the legal needs of the poor " .
23rd street is another main numbered street in manhattan . it begins at fdr drive and ends at eleventh avenue . its length is 3.1 km/1.9m . it has two-way travel . on 23rd street there are five local subway stations :
people of irish descent form the largest single ethnic group in the city , making up 15.8 % of the population , followed by italians , accounting for 8.3 % of the population . people of west indian and caribbean ancestry are another sizable group , at 6.0 % , about half of whom are of haitian ancestry . over 27,000 chinese americans made their home in boston city proper in 2013 , and the city hosts a growing chinatown accommodating heavily traveled chinese-owned bus lines to and from chinatown , manhattan . some neighborhoods , such as dorchester , have received an influx of people of vietnamese ancestry in recent decades . neighborhoods such as jamaica plain and roslindale have experienced a growing number of dominican americans . the city and greater area also has a growing immigrant population of south asians , including the tenth-largest indian community in the country .
the genocide was implemented in two phases : the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour , followed by the deportation of women , children , the elderly and infirm on death marches leading to the syrian desert . driven forward by military escorts , the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery , rape , and massacre . there was local armenian resistance in the region , developed against the activities of the ottoman empire . the events of 1915 to 1917 are regarded by armenians and the vast majority of western historians to have been state-sponsored mass killings , or genocide .
modern-day nigeria has been the site of numerous kingdoms and tribal states over the millennia . the modern state originated from british colonial rule beginning in the 19th century , and the merging of the southern nigeria protectorate and northern nigeria protectorate in 1914 . the british set up administrative and legal structures whilst practising indirect rule through traditional chiefdoms . nigeria became a formally independent federation in 1960 , and plunged into a civil war from 1967 to 1970 . it has since alternated between democratically-elected civilian governments and military dictatorships , until it achieved a stable democracy in 1999 , with its 2011 presidential elections being viewed as the first to be conducted reasonably freely and fairly .
the superior god of oeselians as described by henry of latvia was called tharapita . according to the legend in the chronicle tharapita was born on a forested mountain in virumaa ( latin : vironia ) , mainland estonia from where he flew to oesel , saaremaa the name taarapita has been interpreted as " taara , help ! " / " thor , help ! " ( taara a ( v ) ita in estonian ) or " taara keeper " / " thor keeper " ( taara pidaja ) taara is associated with the scandinavian god thor . the story of tharapita 's or taara 's flight from vironia to saaremaa has been associated with a major meteor disaster estimated to have happened in 660 ± 85 bc that formed kaali crater in saaremaa .
windows 8 introduced major changes to the operating system 's platform and user interface to improve its user experience on tablets , where windows was now competing with mobile operating systems , including android and ios . in particular , these changes included a touch-optimized windows shell based on microsoft 's " metro " design language , the start screen ( which displays programs and dynamically updated content on a grid of tiles ) , a new platform for developing apps with an emphasis on touchscreen input , integration with online services ( including the ability to sync apps and settings between devices ) , and windows store , an online store for downloading and purchasing new software . windows 8 added support for usb 3.0 , advanced format hard drives , near field communications , and cloud computing . additional security features were introduced , such as built-in antivirus software , integration with microsoft smartscreen phishing filtering service and support for uefi secure boot on supported devices with uefi firmware , to prevent malware from infecting the boot process .
the assumption that black-body radiation is thermal leads to an accurate prediction : the total amount of emitted energy goes up with the temperature according to a definite rule , the stefan–boltzmann law ( 1879–84 ) . but it was also known that the colour of the light given off by a hot object changes with the temperature , so that " white hot " is hotter than " red hot " . nevertheless , wilhelm wien discovered the mathematical relationship between the peaks of the curves at different temperatures , by using the principle of adiabatic invariance . at each different temperature , the curve is moved over by wien 's displacement law ( 1893 ) . wien also proposed an approximation for the spectrum of the object , which was correct at high frequencies ( short wavelength ) but not at low frequencies ( long wavelength ) . it still was not clear why the spectrum of a hot object had the form that it has ( see diagram ) .
according to hampshire constabulary figures , southampton is currently safer than it has ever been before , with dramatic reductions in violent crime year on year for the last three years . data from the southampton safer city partnership shows there has been a reduction in all crimes in recent years and an increase in crime detection rates . according to government figures southampton has a higher crime rate than the national average . there is some controversy regarding comparative crime statisitics due to inconsistencies between different police forces recording methodologies . for example , in hampshire all reported incidents are recorded and all records then retained . however , in neighbouring dorset crimes reports withdrawn or shown to be false are not recorded , reducing apparent crime figures . in the violence against the person category , the national average is 16.7 per 1000 population while southampton is 42.4 per 1000 population . in the theft from a vehicle category , the national average is 7.6 per 1000 compared to southampton 's 28.4 per 1000 . overall , for every 1,000 people in the city , 202 crimes are recorded . hampshire constabulary 's figures for 2009/10 show fewer incidents of recorded crime in southampton than the previous year .
though they have not had the level of exposure as other wrestlers , bears have long been a part of professional wrestling . usually declawed and muzzled , they often wrestled shoot matches against audience members , offered a cash reward if they could pin the bear . they also wrestled professionals in worked , often battle royal or handicap , matches ( usually booked so the bear won ) . though they have wrestled around the world and continue to do so , wrestling bears enjoyed their greatest popularity in the southern united states , during the 1960s and 1970s . the practice of bear wrestling has met strong opposition from animal rights activists in recent decades , contributing to its lack of mainstream acceptance . as of 2006 , it is banned in 20 u.s. states . perhaps the most famous wrestling bears are ginger , victor , hercules and terrible ted .
in 1526 , babur , a timurid descendant of timur and genghis khan from fergana valley ( modern day uzbekistan ) , swept across the khyber pass and established the mughal empire , which at its zenith covered modern day afghanistan , pakistan , india and bangladesh . however , his son humayun was defeated by the afghan warrior sher shah suri in the year 1540 , and humayun was forced to retreat to kabul . after sher shah 's death , his son islam shah suri and the hindu emperor hemu vikramaditya , who had won 22 battles against afghan rebels and forces of akbar , from punjab to bengal and had established a secular rule in north india from delhi till 1556 after winning battle of delhi . akbar 's forces defeated and killed hemu in the second battle of panipat on 6 november 1556 .
along with the rest of south west england , somerset has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country . the annual mean temperature is approximately 10 °c ( 50.0 °f ) . seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the united kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures . the summer months of july and august are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately 21 °c ( 69.8 °f ) . in winter mean minimum temperatures of 1 °c ( 33.8 °f ) or 2 °c ( 35.6 °f ) are common . in the summer the azores high pressure affects the south-west of england , but convective cloud sometimes forms inland , reducing the number of hours of sunshine . annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours . in december 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at yeovilton . most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by atlantic depressions or by convection . most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the atlantic depressions , which is when they are most active . in summer , a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms . average rainfall is around 700 mm ( 28 in ) . about 8–15 days of snowfall is typical . november to march have the highest mean wind speeds , and june to august the lightest winds . the predominant wind direction is from the south-west .
in 2002 , a three judge panel on the ninth circuit court of appeals held that classroom recitation of the pledge of allegiance in a california public school was unconstitutional , even when students were not compelled to recite it , due to the inclusion of the phrase " under god . " in reaction to the case , elk grove unified school district v. newdow , both houses of congress passed measures reaffirming their support for the pledge , and condemning the panel 's ruling . the case was appealed to the supreme court , where the case was ultimately overturned in june 2004 , solely on procedural grounds not related to the substantive constitutional issue . rather , a five-justice majority held that newdow , a non-custodial parent suing on behalf of his daughter , lacked standing to sue .
within hours of the uk and france declaring war on germany on 3 september 1939 , the raf bombed german warships along the german coast at wilhelmshaven . thereafter bombing operations were against ports and shipping and propaganda leaflet drops . operations were planned to minimize civilian casualties . from 15 may 1940 – the day after the luftwaffe destroyed the centre of rotterdam – the raf also carried out operations east of the rhine , attacking industrial and transportation targets . operations were carried out every night thereafter .
the beginning of the neolithic culture is considered to be in the levant ( jericho , modern-day west bank ) about 10,200 – 8,800 bc . it developed directly from the epipaleolithic natufian culture in the region , whose people pioneered the use of wild cereals , which then evolved into true farming . the natufian period was between 12,000 and 10,200 bc , and the so-called " proto-neolithic " is now included in the pre-pottery neolithic ( ppna ) between 10,200 and 8,800 bc . as the natufians had become dependent on wild cereals in their diet , and a sedentary way of life had begun among them , the climatic changes associated with the younger dryas are thought to have forced people to develop farming .
in the 1950 parliamentary elections , the wafd party of el-nahhas gained a victory—mostly due to the absence of the muslim brotherhood , which boycotted the elections—and was perceived as a threat by the free officers as the wafd had campaigned on demands similar to their own . accusations of corruption against wafd politicians began to surface , however , breeding an atmosphere of rumor and suspicion that consequently brought the free officers to the forefront of egyptian politics . by then , the organization had expanded to around ninety members ; according to khaled mohieddin , " nobody knew all of them and where they belonged in the hierarchy except nasser " . nasser felt that the free officers were not ready to move against the government and , for nearly two years , he did little beyond officer recruitment and underground news bulletins .
in the late renaissance various writers began to question the medieval and classical understanding of knowledge acquisition in a more fundamental way . in political and historical writing niccolò machiavelli and his friend francesco guicciardini initiated a new realistic style of writing . machiavelli in particular was scornful of writers on politics who judged everything in comparison to mental ideals and demanded that people should study the " effectual truth " instead . their contemporary , leonardo da vinci ( 1452–1519 ) said , " if you find from your own experience that something is a fact and it contradicts what some authority has written down , then you must abandon the authority and base your reasoning on your own findings . "
brahmi evolved into a multiplicity of brahmic scripts , many of which were used to write sanskrit . roughly contemporary with the brahmi , kharosthi was used in the northwest of the subcontinent . sometime between the fourth and eighth centuries , the gupta script , derived from brahmi , became prevalent . around the eighth century , the śāradā script evolved out of the gupta script . the latter was displaced in its turn by devanagari in the 11th or 12th century , with intermediary stages such as the siddhaṃ script . in east india , the bengali alphabet , and , later , the odia alphabet , were used .
the city of rome had a place called the campus martius ( " field of mars " ) , which was a sort of drill ground for roman soldiers . later , the campus became rome 's track and field playground . in the campus , the youth assembled to play and exercise , which included jumping , wrestling , boxing and racing . [ citation needed ] equestrian sports , throwing , and swimming were also preferred physical activities . [ citation needed ] in the countryside , pastimes included fishing and hunting . [ citation needed ] board games played in rome included dice ( tesserae or tali ) , roman chess ( latrunculi ) , roman checkers ( calculi ) , tic-tac-toe ( terni lapilli ) , and ludus duodecim scriptorum and tabula , predecessors of backgammon . other activities included chariot races , and musical and theatrical performances .

in 1945 , the first formal women 's barbershop organization , sweet adelines , was formed . in 1953 sweet adelines became an international organization , although it did n't change its name to sweet adelines international until 1991 . the membership of nearly 25,000 women , all singing in english , includes choruses in most of the fifty united states as well as in australia , canada , england , finland , germany , ireland , japan , new zealand , scotland , sweden , wales and the netherlands . headquartered in tulsa , oklahoma , the organization encompasses more than 1,200 registered quartets and 600 choruses .
in western societies , skirts , dresses and high-heeled shoes are usually seen as women 's clothing , while neckties are usually seen as men 's clothing . trousers were once seen as exclusively male clothing , but are nowadays worn by both genders . male clothes are often more practical ( that is , they can function well under a wide variety of situations ) , but a wider range of clothing styles are available for females . males are typically allowed to bare their chests in a greater variety of public places . it is generally acceptable for a woman to wear traditionally male clothing , while the converse is unusual .
sandra laing is a south african woman who was classified as coloured by authorities during the apartheid era , due to her skin colour and hair texture , although her parents could prove at least three generations of european ancestors . at age 10 , she was expelled from her all-white school . the officials ' decisions based on her anomalous appearance disrupted her family and adult life . she was the subject of the 2008 biographical dramatic film skin , which won numerous awards .
following the events in olympia , there were reports that china requested permission to deploy people 's liberation army personnel along the relay route to protect the flame in canberra . australian authorities stated that such a request , if it were to be made , would be refused . chinese officials labeled it a rumor . australian police have been given powers to search relay spectators , following a call by the chinese students and scholars association for chinese australian students to " go defend our sacred torch " against " ethnic degenerate scum and anti-china separatists " . tony goh , chairman of the australian council of chinese organisations , has said the acco would be taking " thousands " of pro-beijing demonstrators to canberra by bus , to support the torch relay . zhang rongan , a chinese australian student organising pro-beijing demonstrations , told the press that chinese diplomats were assisting with the organization of buses , meals and accommodation for pro-beijing demonstrators , and helping them organise a " peaceful show of strength " . foreign minister stephen smith said chinese officials were urging supporters to " turn up and put a point of view " , but that he had no objection to it as long as they remained peaceful .
the fbi laboratory , established with the formation of the boi , did not appear in the j. edgar hoover building until its completion in 1974 . the lab serves as the primary lab for most dna , biological , and physical work . public tours of fbi headquarters ran through the fbi laboratory workspace before the move to the j. edgar hoover building . the services the lab conducts include chemistry , combined dna index system ( codis ) , computer analysis and response , dna analysis , evidence response , explosives , firearms and tool marks , forensic audio , forensic video , image analysis , forensic science research , forensic science training , hazardous materials response , investigative and prospective graphics , latent prints , materials analysis , questioned documents , racketeering records , special photographic analysis , structural design , and trace evidence . the services of the fbi laboratory are used by many state , local , and international agencies free of charge . the lab also maintains a second lab at the fbi academy .
the social identity of the children was strongly determined by the tribe 's kinship system . among the matrilineal tribes of the southeast , the mixed-race children generally were accepted as and identified as indian , as they gained their social status from their mother 's clans and tribes , and often grew up with their mothers and their male relatives . by contrast , among the patrilineal omaha , for example , the child of a white man and omaha woman was considered " white " ; such mixed-race children and their mothers would be protected , but the children could formally belong to the tribe as members only if adopted by a man .
plymouth also has 71 state primary phase schools , 13 state secondary schools , eight special schools and three selective state grammar schools , devonport high school for girls , devonport high school for boys and plymouth high school for girls . there is also an independent school plymouth college .
child labour accounts for 22 % of the workforce in asia , 32 % in africa , 17 % in latin america , 1 % in the us , canada , europe and other wealthy nations . the proportion of child labourers varies greatly among countries and even regions inside those countries . africa has the highest percentage of children aged 5–17 employed as child labour , and a total of over 65 million . asia , with its larger population , has the largest number of children employed as child labour at about 114 million . latin america and caribbean region have lower overall population density , but at 14 million child labourers has high incidence rates too .
glacial bodies larger than 50,000 km2 ( 19,000 sq mi ) are called ice sheets or continental glaciers . several kilometers deep , they obscure the underlying topography . only nunataks protrude from their surfaces . the only extant ice sheets are the two that cover most of antarctica and greenland . they contain vast quantities of fresh water , enough that if both melted , global sea levels would rise by over 70 m ( 230 ft ) . portions of an ice sheet or cap that extend into water are called ice shelves ; they tend to be thin with limited slopes and reduced velocities . narrow , fast-moving sections of an ice sheet are called ice streams . in antarctica , many ice streams drain into large ice shelves . some drain directly into the sea , often with an ice tongue , like mertz glacier .
there is a wide consensus that the racial categories that are common in everyday usage are socially constructed , and that racial groups can not be biologically defined . nonetheless , some scholars argue that racial categories obviously correlate with biological traits ( e.g . phenotype ) to some degree , and that certain genetic markers have varying frequencies among human populations , some of which correspond more or less to traditional racial groupings . for this reason , there is no current consensus about whether racial categories can be considered to have significance for understanding human genetic variation .
new york city 's public bus fleet is the largest in north america , and the port authority bus terminal , the main intercity bus terminal of the city , serves 7,000 buses and 200,000 commuters daily , making it the busiest bus station in the world .
presbyterianism is historically a confessional tradition . this has two implications . the obvious one is that confessional churches express their faith in the form of " confessions of faith , " which have some level of authoritative status . however this is based on a more subtle point : in confessional churches , theology is not solely an individual matter . while individuals are encouraged to understand scripture , and may challenge the current institutional understanding , theology is carried out by the community as a whole . it is this community understanding of theology that is expressed in confessions .
the nucleotide sequence of a gene 's dna specifies the amino acid sequence of a protein through the genetic code . sets of three nucleotides , known as codons , each correspond to a specific amino acid . :6 additionally , a " start codon " , and three " stop codons " indicate the beginning and end of the protein coding region . there are 64 possible codons ( four possible nucleotides at each of three positions , hence 43 possible codons ) and only 20 standard amino acids ; hence the code is redundant and multiple codons can specify the same amino acid . the correspondence between codons and amino acids is nearly universal among all known living organisms .
the first successful light bulb filaments were made of carbon ( from carbonized paper or bamboo ) . early carbon filaments had a negative temperature coefficient of resistance — as they got hotter , their electrical resistance decreased . this made the lamp sensitive to fluctuations in the power supply , since a small increase of voltage would cause the filament to heat up , reducing its resistance and causing it to draw even more power and heat even further . in the " flashing " process , carbon filaments were heated by current passing through them while in an evacuated vessel containing hydrocarbon vapor ( usually gasoline ) . the carbon deposited on the filament by this treatment improved the uniformity and strength of filaments as well as their efficiency . a metallized or " graphitized " filament was first heated in a high-temperature oven before flashing and lamp assembly . this transformed the carbon into graphite which further strengthened and smoothed the filament . this also changed the filament to have a positive temperature coefficient , like a metallic conductor , and helped stabilize the lamp 's power consumption , temperature and light output against minor variations in supply voltage .
in spite of their flaws , such as the lack of portability , records still have enthusiastic supporters . vinyl records continue to be manufactured and sold today , especially by independent rock bands and labels , although record sales are considered to be a niche market composed of audiophiles , collectors , and djs . old records and out-of-print recordings in particular are in much demand by collectors the world over . ( see record collecting . ) many popular new albums are given releases on vinyl records and older albums are also given reissues , sometimes on audiophile-grade vinyl .
a brash boosterism that had typified melbourne during this time ended in the early 1890s with a severe depression of the city 's economy , sending the local finance and property industries into a period of chaos during which 16 small " land banks " and building societies collapsed , and 133 limited companies went into liquidation . the melbourne financial crisis was a contributing factor in the australian economic depression of the 1890s and the australian banking crisis of 1893 . the effects of the depression on the city were profound , with virtually no new construction until the late 1890s .
the first digimon anime introduced the digimon life cycle : they age in a similar fashion to real organisms , but do not die under normal circumstances because they are made of reconfigurable data , which can be seen throughout the show . any digimon that receives a fatal wound will dissolve into infinitesimal bits of data . the data then recomposes itself as a digi-egg , which will hatch when rubbed gently , and the digimon goes through its life cycle again . digimon who are reincarnated in this way will sometimes retain some or all their memories of their previous life . however , if a digimon 's data is completely destroyed , they will die .
the company 's 14 member board of directors is responsible for overall corporate management . as of cathie black 's resignation in november 2010 its membership ( by affiliation and year of joining ) included : alain j. p. belda '08 ( alcoa ) , william r. brody '07 ( salk institute / johns hopkins university ) , kenneth chenault '98 ( american express ) , michael l. eskew '05 ( ups ) , shirley ann jackson '05 ( rensselaer polytechnic institute ) , andrew n. liveris '10 ( dow chemical ) , w. james mcnerney , jr.

by the early 2000s , laserdisc was completely replaced by dvd in the north american retail marketplace , as neither players nor software were then produced . players were still exported to north america from japan until the end of 2001 . the format has retained some popularity among american collectors , and to a greater degree in japan , where the format was better supported and more prevalent during its life . in europe , laserdisc always remained an obscure format . it was chosen by the british broadcasting corporation ( bbc ) for the bbc domesday project in the mid-1980s , a school-based project to commemorate 900 years since the original domesday book in england . from 1991 up until the early 2000s , the bbc also used laserdisc technology to play out the channel idents .
with roots dating back to 1909 in the university 's school of social economy , the george warren brown school of social work ( commonly called the brown school or brown ) was founded in 1925 . brown 's academic degree offerings include a master of social work ( msw ) , a master of public health ( mph ) , a phd in social work , and a phd in public health sciences . it is currently ranked first among master of social work programs in the united states . the school was endowed by bettie bofinger brown and named for her husband , george warren brown , a st. louis philanthropist and co-founder of the brown shoe company . the school was the first in the country to have a building for the purpose of social work education , and it is also a founding member of the association of schools and programs of public health . the school is housed within brown and goldfarb halls , but a third building expansion is currently in progress and slated to be completed in summer 2015 . the new building , adjacent to brown and goldfarb halls , targets leed gold certification and will add approximately 105,000 square feet , more than doubling the school 's teaching , research , and program space .
after the formal end of reconstruction , the struggle over power in southern society continued . through violence and intimidation against freedmen and their allies , white democrats regained political power in tennessee and other states across the south in the late 1870s and 1880s . over the next decade , the state legislature passed increasingly restrictive laws to control african americans . in 1889 the general assembly passed four laws described as electoral reform , with the cumulative effect of essentially disfranchising most african americans in rural areas and small towns , as well as many poor whites . legislation included implementation of a poll tax , timing of registration , and recording requirements . tens of thousands of taxpaying citizens were without representation for decades into the 20th century . disfranchising legislation accompanied jim crow laws passed in the late 19th century , which imposed segregation in the state . in 1900 , african americans made up nearly 24 % of the state 's population , and numbered 480,430 citizens who lived mostly in the central and western parts of the state .
on july 26 , 1931 , at a convention in columbus , ohio , rutherford introduced the new name—jehovah 's witnesses—based on isaiah 43:10 : " ye are my witnesses , saith jehovah , and my servant whom i have chosen " —which was adopted by resolution . the name was chosen to distinguish his group of bible students from other independent groups that had severed ties with the society , as well as symbolize the instigation of new outlooks and the promotion of fresh evangelizing methods . in 1932 , rutherford eliminated the system of locally elected elders and in 1938 , introduced what he called a " theocratic " ( literally , god-ruled ) organizational system , under which appointments in congregations worldwide were made from the brooklyn headquarters .
feathers are a feature characteristic of birds ( though also present in some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds ) . they facilitate flight , provide insulation that aids in thermoregulation , and are used in display , camouflage , and signaling . there are several types of feathers , each serving its own set of purposes . feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called pterylae . the distribution pattern of these feather tracts ( pterylosis ) is used in taxonomy and systematics . the arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body , called plumage , may vary within species by age , social status , and sex .
reaction to the novel varied widely upon publication . literary analysis of it is sparse , considering the number of copies sold and its widespread use in education . author mary mcdonough murphy , who collected individual impressions of to kill a mockingbird by several authors and public figures , calls the book , " an astonishing phenomenon " . in 2006 , british librarians ranked the book ahead of the bible as one " every adult should read before they die " . it was adapted into an oscar-winning film in 1962 by director robert mulligan , with a screenplay by horton foote . since 1990 , a play based on the novel has been performed annually in harper lee 's hometown of monroeville , alabama .
xbox live arcade is an online service operated by microsoft that is used to distribute downloadable video games to xbox and xbox 360 owners . in addition to classic arcade games such as ms. pac-man , the service offers some new original games like assault heroes . the xbox live arcade also features games from other consoles , such as the playstation game castlevania : symphony of the night and pc games such as zuma . the service was first launched on november 3 , 2004 , using a dvd to load , and offered games for about us $ 5 to $ 15 . items are purchased using microsoft points , a proprietary currency used to reduce credit card transaction charges . on november 22 , 2005 , xbox live arcade was re-launched with the release of the xbox 360 , in which it was now integrated with the xbox 360 's dashboard . the games are generally aimed toward more casual gamers ; examples of the more popular titles are geometry wars , street fighter ii ' hyper fighting , and uno . on march 24 , 2010 , microsoft introduced the game room to xbox live . game room is a gaming service for xbox 360 and microsoft windows that lets players compete in classic arcade and console games in a virtual arcade .
perhaps the most famous raid by oeselian pirates occurred in 1187 , with the attack on the swedish town of sigtuna by finnic raiders from couronia and oesel . among the casualties of this raid was the swedish archbishop johannes . the city remained occupied for some time , contributing to its decline as a center of commerce in the 13th century and the rise of uppsala , visby , kalmar and stockholm . the livonian chronicle describes the oeselians as using two kinds of ships , the piratica and the liburna . the former was a warship , the latter mainly a merchant ship . a piratica could carry approximately 30 men and had a high prow shaped like a dragon or a snakehead and a rectangular sail . viking-age treasures from estonia mostly contain silver coins and bars . saaremaa has the richest finds of viking treasures after gotland in sweden . this strongly suggests that estonia was an important transit country during the viking era .
in the west , the russians were dissuaded from attacking vidin by the presence of the austrian forces , which had swelled to 280,000 men . on 28 may 1854 a protocol of the vienna conference was signed by austria and russia . one of the aims of the russian advance had been to encourage the orthodox christian serbs and bulgarians living under ottoman rule to rebel . however , when the russian troops actually crossed the river pruth into moldavia , the orthodox christians still showed no interest in rising up against the turks . :131 , 137 adding to the worries of nicholas i was the concern that austria would enter the war against the russians and attack his armies on the western flank . indeed , after attempting to mediate a peaceful settlement between russia and turkey , the austrians entered the war on the side of turkey with an attack against the russians in the principalities which threatened to cut off the russian supply lines . accordingly , the russians were forced to raise the siege of silistra on 23 june 1854 , and begin abandoning the principalities . :185 the lifting of the siege reduced the threat of a russian advance into bulgaria .
due to the ratio of u.s. and mexican-licensed stations , san diego is the largest media market in the united states that is legally unable to support a television station duopoly between two full-power stations under fcc regulations , which disallow duopolies in metropolitan areas with fewer than nine full-power television stations and require that there must be eight unique station owners that remain once a duopoly is formed ( there are only seven full-power stations on the california side of the san diego-tijuana market ) . [ citation needed ] though the e. w. scripps company owns kgtv and kzsd-lp , they are not considered a duopoly under the fcc 's legal definition as common ownership between full-power and low-power television stations in the same market is permitted regardless to the number of stations licensed to the area . as a whole , the mexico side of the san diego-tijuana market has two duopolies and one triopoly ( entravision communications owns both xhas-tv and xhdtv-tv , azteca owns xhjk-tv and xhtit-tv , and grupo televisa owns xhuaa-tv and xhwt-tv along with being the license holder for xetv-tv , which is run by california-based subsidiary bay city television ) .
there were guilds of dyers who specialized in red in venice and other large europeans cities . the rubia plant was used to make the most common dye ; it produced an orange-red or brick red color used to dye the clothes of merchants and artisans . for the wealthy , the dye used was kermes , made from a tiny scale insect which fed on the branches and leaves of the oak tree . for those with even more money there was polish cochineal ; also known as kermes vermilio or " blood of saint john " , which was made from a related insect , the margodes polonicus . it made a more vivid red than ordinary kermes . the finest and most expensive variety of red made from insects was the " kermes " of armenia ( armenian cochineal , also known as persian kirmiz ) , made by collecting and crushing porphyophora hamelii , an insect which lived on the roots and stems of certain grasses . the pigment and dye merchants of venice imported and sold all of these products and also manufactured their own color , called venetian red , which was considered the most expensive and finest red in europe . its secret ingredient was arsenic , which brightened the color .
as of 2000 [ update ] , children and teenagers ( 0–19 years old ) make up 15.1 % of the population , while adults ( 20–64 years old ) make up 65 % and seniors ( over 64 years old ) make up 19.9 % .
in his early years popper was impressed by marxism , whether of communists or socialists . an event that happened in 1919 had a profound effect on him : during a riot , caused by the communists , the police shot several unarmed people , including some of popper 's friends , when they tried to free party comrades from prison . the riot had , in fact , been part of a plan by which leaders of the communist party with connections to béla kun tried to take power by a coup ; popper did not know about this at that time . however , he knew that the riot instigators were swayed by the marxist doctrine that class struggle would produce vastly more dead men than the inevitable revolution brought about as quickly as possible , and so had no scruples to put the life of the rioters at risk to achieve their selfish goal of becoming the future leaders of the working class . this was the start of his later criticism of historicism . popper began to reject marxist historicism , which he associated with questionable means , and later socialism , which he associated with placing equality before freedom ( to the possible disadvantage of equality ) .
although spoken tibetan varies according to the region , the written language , based on classical tibetan , is consistent throughout . this is probably due to the long-standing influence of the tibetan empire , whose rule embraced ( and extended at times far beyond ) the present tibetan linguistic area , which runs from northern pakistan in the west to yunnan and sichuan in the east , and from north of qinghai lake south as far as bhutan . the tibetan language has its own script which it shares with ladakhi and dzongkha , and which is derived from the ancient indian brāhmī script .
under peter i ( the great ) , russia was proclaimed an empire in 1721 and became recognized as a world power . ruling from 1682 to 1725 , peter defeated sweden in the great northern war , forcing it to cede west karelia and ingria ( two regions lost by russia in the time of troubles ) , as well as estland and livland , securing russia 's access to the sea and sea trade . on the baltic sea peter founded a new capital called saint petersburg , later known as russia 's window to europe . peter the great 's reforms brought considerable western european cultural influences to russia . catherine ii ( the great ) , who ruled in 1762–96 , extended russian political control over the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and incorporated most of its territories into russia during the partitions of poland , pushing the russian frontier westward into central europe . in the south , after successful russo-turkish wars against the ottoman empire , catherine advanced russia 's boundary to the black sea , defeating the crimean khanate .
the majapahit empire was an indianised kingdom based in eastern java from 1293 to around 1500 . its greatest ruler was hayam wuruk , whose reign from 1350 to 1389 marked the empire 's peak when it dominated other kingdoms in the southern malay peninsula , borneo , sumatra , and bali . various sources such as the nagarakertagama also mention that its influence spanned over parts of sulawesi , maluku , and some areas of western new guinea and the philippines , making it the largest empire to ever exist in southeast asian history .
the san diego surf of the american basketball association is located in the city . the annual farmers insurance open golf tournament ( formerly the buick invitational ) on the pga tour occurs at torrey pines golf course . this course was also the site of the 2008 u.s. open golf championship . the san diego yacht club hosted the america 's cup yacht races three times during the period 1988 to 1995 . the amateur beach sport over-the-line was invented in san diego , and the annual world over-the-line championships are held at mission bay every year .
traditional sports include swiss wrestling or " schwingen " . it is an old tradition from the rural central cantons and considered the national sport by some . hornussen is another indigenous swiss sport , which is like a cross between baseball and golf . steinstossen is the swiss variant of stone put , a competition in throwing a heavy stone . practiced only among the alpine population since prehistoric times , it is recorded to have taken place in basel in the 13th century . it is also central to the unspunnenfest , first held in 1805 , with its symbol the 83.5 kg stone named unspunnenstein .
dell had a reputation as a company that relied upon supply chain efficiencies to sell established technologies at low prices , instead of being an innovator . by the mid-2000s many analysts were looking to innovating companies as the next source of growth in the technology sector . dell 's low spending on r & d relative to its revenue ( compared to ibm , hewlett packard , and apple inc. ) —which worked well in the commoditized pc market—prevented it from making inroads into more lucrative segments , such as mp3 players and later mobile devices . increasing spending on r & d would have cut into the operating margins that the company emphasized . dell had done well with a horizontal organization that focused on pcs when the computing industry moved to horizontal mix-and-match layers in the 1980s , but by the mid-2000 the industry shifted to vertically integrated stacks to deliver complete it solutions and dell lagged far behind competitors like hewlett packard and oracle .
the soviet success caused public controversy in the united states , and eisenhower ordered the civilian rocket and satellite project , vanguard , to move up its timetable and launch its satellite much sooner than originally planned . the december 6 , 1957 project vanguard launch failure occurred at cape canaveral air force station in florida , broadcast live in front of a us television audience . it was a monumental failure , exploding a few seconds after launch , and it became an international joke . the satellite appeared in newspapers under the names flopnik , stayputnik , kaputnik , and dudnik . in the united nations , the russian delegate offered the u.s. representative aid " under the soviet program of technical assistance to backwards nations . " only in the wake of this very public failure did von braun 's redstone team get the go-ahead to launch their jupiter-c rocket as soon as they could . in britain , the usa 's western cold war ally , the reaction was mixed : some members of the population celebrated the fact that the soviets had reached space first , while others feared the destructive potential that military uses of spacecraft might bring .
since the system 's launch , production costs have been reduced significantly as a result of phasing out the emotion engine chip and falling hardware costs . the cost of manufacturing cell microprocessors has fallen dramatically as a result of moving to the 65 nm production process , and blu-ray disc diodes have become cheaper to manufacture . as of january 2008 , each unit cost around $ 400 to manufacture ; by august 2009 , sony had reduced costs by a total of 70 % , meaning it only costs sony around $ 240 per unit .
after a major blaze in 1405 , the city 's original wooden buildings were gradually replaced by half-timbered houses and subsequently the sandstone buildings which came to be characteristic for the old town . despite the waves of pestilence that hit europe in the 14th century , the city continued to grow : mainly due to immigration from the surrounding countryside .
originally , each branch and agency of the u.s. government was responsible for maintaining its own documents , which often resulted in records loss and destruction . congress established the national archives establishment in 1934 to centralize federal record keeping , with the archivist of the united states as chief administrator . the national archives was incorporated with gsa in 1949 ; in 1985 it became an independent agency as nara ( national archives and records administration ) .
in the oft-cited and oft-criticized sexual behavior in the human male ( 1948 ) and sexual behavior in the human female ( 1953 ) , by alfred c. kinsey et al. , people were asked to rate themselves on a scale from completely heterosexual to completely homosexual . kinsey reported that when the individuals ' behavior as well as their identity are analyzed , most people appeared to be at least somewhat bisexual — i.e. , most people have some attraction to either sex , although usually one sex is preferred . according to kinsey , only a minority ( 5–10 % ) can be considered fully heterosexual or homosexual . [ citation needed ] conversely , only an even smaller minority can be considered fully bisexual ( with an equal attraction to both sexes ) . kinsey 's methods have been criticized as flawed , particularly with regard to the randomness of his sample population , which included prison inmates , male prostitutes and those who willingly participated in discussion of previously taboo sexual topics . nevertheless , paul gebhard , subsequent director of the kinsey institute for sex research , reexamined the data in the kinsey reports and concluded that removing the prison inmates and prostitutes barely affected the results .
collectively encompassing more than 900 million adherents , or nearly forty percent of christians worldwide , protestantism is present on all populated continents . [ t ] the movement is more divided theologically and ecclesiastically than either eastern orthodoxy or roman catholicism , lacking both structural unity and central human authority . some protestant churches do have a worldwide scope and distribution of membership ( notably , the anglican communion ) , while others are confined to a single country , or even are solitary church bodies or congregations ( such as the former prussian union of churches ) . nondenominational , evangelical , independent and other churches are on the rise , and constitute a significant part of protestant christianity .
from 1842 onwards , chopin showed signs of serious illness . after a solo recital in paris on 21 february 1842 , he wrote to grzymała : " i have to lie in bed all day long , my mouth and tonsils are aching so much . " he was forced by illness to decline a written invitation from alkan to participate in a repeat performance of the beethoven seventh symphony arrangement at erard 's on 1 march 1843 . late in 1844 , charles hallé visited chopin and found him " hardly able to move , bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain " , although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor . chopin 's health continued to deteriorate , particularly from this time onwards . modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses , he may also have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy .
the first example is taken from the opening lines of the folk-epic beowulf , a poem of some 3,000 lines and the single greatest work of old english . this passage describes how hrothgar 's legendary ancestor scyld was found as a baby , washed ashore , and adopted by a noble family . the translation is literal and represents the original poetic word order . as such , it is not typical of old english prose . the modern cognates of original words have been used whenever practical to give a close approximation of the feel of the original poem .
wu chinese has a three-way distinction in stops and affricates : /p pʰ b/ . in addition to aspirated and unaspirated consonants , there is a series of muddy consonants , like /b/ . these are pronounced with slack or breathy voice : that is , they are weakly voiced . muddy consonants as initial cause a syllable to be pronounced with low pitch or light ( 陽 yáng ) tone .
the personal copying exemption in the copyright law of eu member states stems from the eu copyright directive of 2001 , which is generally devised to allow eu members to enact laws sanctioning making copies without authorization , as long as they are for personal , noncommerical use . the copyright directive was not intended to legitimize file-sharing , but rather the common practice of space shifting copyright-protected content from a legally purchased cd ( for example ) to certain kinds of devices and media , provided rights holders are compensated and no copy protection measures are circumvented . rights-holder compensation takes various forms , depending on the country , but is generally either a levy on " recording " devices and media , or a tax on the content itself . in some countries , such as canada , the applicability of such laws to copying onto general-purpose storage devices like computer hard drives , portable media players , and phones , for which no levies are collected , has been the subject of debate and further efforts to reform copyright law .
english is the official language in the state of montana , as it is in many u.s. states . english is also the language of the majority . according to the 2000 u.s. census , 94.8 percent of the population aged 5 and older speak english at home . spanish is the language most commonly spoken at home other than english . there were about 13,040 spanish-language speakers in the state ( 1.4 percent of the population ) in 2011 . there were also 15,438 ( 1.7 percent of the state population ) speakers of indo-european languages other than english or spanish , 10,154 ( 1.1 percent ) speakers of a native american language , and 4,052 ( 0.4 percent ) speakers of an asian or pacific islander language . other languages spoken in montana ( as of 2013 ) include assiniboine ( about 150 speakers in the montana and canada ) , blackfoot ( about 100 speakers ) , cheyenne ( about 1,700 speakers ) , plains cree ( about 100 speakers ) , crow ( about 3,000 speakers ) , dakota ( about 18,800 speakers in minnesota , montana , nebraska , north dakota , and south dakota ) , german hutterite ( about 5,600 speakers ) , gros ventre ( about 10 speakers ) , kalispel-pend d'oreille ( about 64 speakers ) , kutenai ( about 6 speakers ) , and lakota ( about 6,000 speakers in minnesota , montana , nebraska , north dakota , south dakota ) . the united states department of education estimated in 2009 that 5,274 students in montana spoke a language at home other than english . these included a native american language ( 64 percent ) , german ( 4 percent ) , spanish ( 3 percent ) , russian ( 1 percent ) , and chinese ( less than 0.5 percent ) .
in the diffuse-porous woods , the demarcation between rings is not always so clear and in some cases is almost ( if not entirely ) invisible to the unaided eye . conversely , when there is a clear demarcation there may not be a noticeable difference in structure within the growth ring .
non-commercial radio stations include npr affiliates kuow-fm 94.9 and kplu-fm 88.5 ( tacoma ) , as well as classical music station king-fm 98.1 . other stations include kexp-fm 90.3 ( affiliated with the uw ) , community radio kbcs-fm 91.3 ( affiliated with bellevue college ) , and high school radio knhc-fm 89.5 , which broadcasts an electronic dance music radio format and is owned by the public school system and operated by students of nathan hale high school . many seattle radio stations are also available through internet radio , with kexp in particular being a pioneer of internet radio . seattle also has numerous commercial radio stations . in a march 2012 report by the consumer research firm arbitron , the top fm stations were krwm ( adult contemporary format ) , kiro-fm ( news/talk ) , and kisw ( active rock ) while the top am stations were komo ( am ) ( all news ) , kjr ( am ) ( all sports ) , kiro ( am ) ( all sports ) .
the expression of genes encoded in dna begins by transcribing the gene into rna , a second type of nucleic acid that is very similar to dna , but whose monomers contain the sugar ribose rather than deoxyribose . rna also contains the base uracil in place of thymine . rna molecules are less stable than dna and are typically single-stranded . genes that encode proteins are composed of a series of three-nucleotide sequences called codons , which serve as the " words " in the genetic " language " . the genetic code specifies the correspondence during protein translation between codons and amino acids . the genetic code is nearly the same for all known organisms . :4.1
in his 2004 presidential campaign , kerry criticized george w. bush for the iraq war . he and his running mate , north carolina senator john edwards , lost the election , finishing 35 electoral votes behind bush and vice president dick cheney . kerry returned to the senate , becoming chairman of the senate committee on small business and entrepreneurship in 2007 and then of the foreign relations committee in 2009 . in january 2013 , kerry was nominated by president barack obama to succeed outgoing secretary of state hillary clinton and then confirmed by the u.s. senate , assuming the office on february 1 , 2013 .
official cults were state funded as a " matter of public interest " ( res publica ) . non-official but lawful cults were funded by private individuals for the benefit of their own communities . the difference between public and private cult is often unclear . individuals or collegial associations could offer funds and cult to state deities . the public vestals prepared ritual substances for use in public and private cults , and held the state-funded ( thus public ) opening ceremony for the parentalia festival , which was otherwise a private rite to household ancestors . some rites of the domus ( household ) were held in public places but were legally defined as privata in part or whole . all cults were ultimately subject to the approval and regulation of the censor and pontifices .
in march 1861 , victoria 's mother died , with victoria at her side . through reading her mother 's papers , victoria discovered that her mother had loved her deeply ; she was heart-broken , and blamed conroy and lehzen for " wickedly " estranging her from her mother . to relieve his wife during her intense and deep grief , albert took on most of her duties , despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble . in august , victoria and albert visited their son , the prince of wales , who was attending army manoeuvres near dublin , and spent a few days holidaying in killarney . in november , albert was made aware of gossip that his son had slept with an actress in ireland . appalled , albert travelled to cambridge , where his son was studying , to confront him . by the beginning of december , albert was very unwell . he was diagnosed with typhoid fever by william jenner , and died on 14 december 1861 . victoria was devastated . she blamed her husband 's death on worry over the prince of wales 's philandering . he had been " killed by that dreadful business " , she said . she entered a state of mourning and wore black for the remainder of her life . she avoided public appearances , and rarely set foot in london in the following years . her seclusion earned her the nickname " widow of windsor " .
though brazilians of at least partial african heritage make up a large percentage of the population , few blacks have been elected as politicians . the city of salvador , bahia , for instance , is 80 % people of color , but voters have not elected a mayor of color . journalists like to say that us cities with black majorities , such as detroit and new orleans , have not elected white mayors since after the civil rights movement , when the voting rights act of 1965 protected the franchise for minorities , and blacks in the south regained the power to vote for the first time since the turn of the 20th century . new orleans elected its first black mayor in the 1970s . new orleans elected a white mayor after the widescale disruption and damage of hurricane katrina in 2005 .
the tribes were ruled by clans ( ród ) consisting of people related by blood or marriage and theoretically descending from a common ancestor , giving the ród/clan a highly developed sense of solidarity . ( see gens . ) the starosta ( or starszyna ) had judicial and military power over the ród/clan , although this power was often exercised with an assembly of elders . strongholds called grόd were built where the religious cult was powerful , where trials were conducted , and where clans gathered in the face of danger . the opole was the territory occupied by a single tribe . ( manteuffel 1982 , p. 44 )
though britain and the empire emerged victorious from the second world war , the effects of the conflict were profound , both at home and abroad . much of europe , a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries , was in ruins , and host to the armies of the united states and the soviet union , who now held the balance of global power . britain was left essentially bankrupt , with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the negotiation of a $ us 4.33 billion loan ( us $ 56 billion in 2012 ) from the united states , the last instalment of which was repaid in 2006 . at the same time , anti-colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of european nations . the situation was complicated further by the increasing cold war rivalry of the united states and the soviet union . in principle , both nations were opposed to european colonialism . in practice , however , american anti-communism prevailed over anti-imperialism , and therefore the united states supported the continued existence of the british empire to keep communist expansion in check . the " wind of change " ultimately meant that the british empire 's days were numbered , and on the whole , britain adopted a policy of peaceful disengagement from its colonies once stable , non-communist governments were available to transfer power to . this was in contrast to other european powers such as france and portugal , which waged costly and ultimately unsuccessful wars to keep their empires intact . between 1945 and 1965 , the number of people under british rule outside the uk itself fell from 700 million to five million , three million of whom were in hong kong .
four years into the 20th century saw the russo-japanese war with the battle of port arthur establishing the empire of japan as a world power . the russians were in constant pursuit of a warm water port on the pacific ocean , for their navy as well as for maritime trade . the manchurian campaign of the russian empire was fought against the japanese over manchuria and korea . the major theatres of operations were southern manchuria , specifically the area around the liaodong peninsula and mukden , and the seas around korea , japan , and the yellow sea . the resulting campaigns , in which the fledgling japanese military consistently attained victory over the russian forces arrayed against them , were unexpected by world observers . these victories , as time transpired , would dramatically transform the distribution of power in east asia , resulting in a reassessment of japan 's recent entry onto the world stage . the embarrassing string of defeats increased russian popular dissatisfaction with the inefficient and corrupt tsarist government .
although most often associated with the people 's republic of china , character simplification predates the 1949 communist victory . caoshu , cursive written text , almost always includes character simplification , and simplified forms have always existed in print , albeit not for the most formal works . in the 1930s and 1940s , discussions on character simplification took place within the kuomintang government , and a large number of chinese intellectuals and writers have long maintained that character simplification would help boost literacy in china . indeed , this desire by the kuomintang to simplify the chinese writing system ( inherited and implemented by the communist party of china ) also nursed aspirations of some for the adoption of a phonetic script based on the latin script , and spawned such inventions as the gwoyeu romatzyh .
spielberg 's films often deal with several recurring themes . most of his films deal with ordinary characters searching for or coming in contact with extraordinary beings or finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances . in an afi interview in august 2000 spielberg commented on his interest in the possibility of extra terrestrial life and how it has influenced some of his films . spielberg described himself as feeling like an alien during childhood , and his interest came from his father , a science fiction fan , and his opinion that aliens would not travel light years for conquest , but instead curiosity and sharing of knowledge .
the fighter aircraft of the usaf are small , fast , and maneuverable military aircraft primarily used for air-to-air combat . many of these fighters have secondary ground-attack capabilities , and some are dual-roled as fighter-bombers ( e.g. , the f-16 fighting falcon ) ; the term " fighter " is also sometimes used colloquially for dedicated ground-attack aircraft . other missions include interception of bombers and other fighters , reconnaissance , and patrol . the f-16 is currently used by the usaf air demonstration squadron , the thunderbirds , while a small number of both man-rated and non-man-rated f-4 phantom ii are retained as qf-4 aircraft for use as full scale aerial targets ( fsat ) or as part of the usaf heritage flight program . these extant qf-4 aircraft are being replaced in the fsat role by early model f-16 aircraft converted to qf-16 configuration . the usaf has 2,025 fighters in service as of september 2012 .
most mature clitellates ( the group that includes earthworms and leeches ) are full hermaphrodites , although in a few leech species younger adults function as males and become female at maturity . all have well-developed gonads , and all copulate . earthworms store their partners ' sperm in spermathecae ( " sperm stores " ) and then the clitellum produces a cocoon that collects ova from the ovaries and then sperm from the spermathecae . fertilization and development of earthworm eggs takes place in the cocoon . leeches ' eggs are fertilized in the ovaries , and then transferred to the cocoon . in all clitellates the cocoon also either produces yolk when the eggs are fertilized or nutrients while they are developing . all clitellates hatch as miniature adults rather than larvae .
the palace , like windsor castle , is owned by the crown estate . it is not the monarch 's personal property , unlike sandringham house and balmoral castle . many of the contents from buckingham palace , windsor castle , kensington palace , and st james 's palace are part of the royal collection , held in trust by the sovereign ; they can , on occasion , be viewed by the public at the queen 's gallery , near the royal mews . unlike the palace and the castle , the purpose-built gallery is open continually and displays a changing selection of items from the collection . it occupies the site of the chapel destroyed by an air raid in world war ii . the palace 's state rooms have been open to the public during august and september and on selected dates throughout the year since 1993 . the money raised in entry fees was originally put towards the rebuilding of windsor castle after the 1992 fire devastated many of its state rooms . 476,000 people visited the palace in the 2014–15 financial year .
but early in the 16th century , a brilliant new red appeared in europe . when the spanish conquistador hernán cortés and his soldiers conquered the aztec empire in 1519-1521 , they discovered slowly that the aztecs had another treasure beside silver and gold ; they had the tiny cochineal , a parasitic scale insect which lived on cactus plants , which , when dried and crushed , made a magnificent red . the cochineal in mexico was closely related to the kermes varieties of europe , but unlike european kermes , it could be harvested several times a year , and it was ten times stronger than the kermes of poland . it worked particularly well on silk , satin and other luxury textiles . in 1523 cortes sent the first shipment to spain . soon cochineal began to arrive in european ports aboard convoys of spanish galleons .
in physics , whitehead 's thought has had some influence . he articulated a view that might perhaps be regarded as dual to einstein 's general relativity , see whitehead 's theory of gravitation . it has been severely criticized . yutaka tanaka , who suggests that the gravitational constant disagrees with experimental findings , proposes that einstein 's work does not actually refute whitehead 's formulation . whitehead 's view has now been rendered obsolete , with the discovery of gravitational waves . they are phenonena observed locally that largely violate the kind of local flatness of space that whitehead assumes . consequently , whitehead 's cosmology must be regarded as a local approximation , and his assumption of a uniform spatio-temporal geometry , minkowskian in particular , as an often-locally-adequate approximation . an exact replacement of whitehead 's cosmology would need to admit a riemannian geometry . also , although whitehead himself gave only secondary consideration to quantum theory , his metaphysics of processes has proved attractive to some physicists in that field . henry stapp and david bohm are among those whose work has been influenced by whitehead .
the human development report for 2007/2008 was launched in brasília , brazil , on november 27 , 2007 . its focus was on " fighting climate change : human solidarity in a divided world . " most of the data used for the report are derived largely from 2005 or earlier , thus indicating an hdi for 2005 . not all un member states choose to or are able to provide the necessary statistics .
the second great awakening began around 1790 . it gained momentum by 1800 . after 1820 , membership rose rapidly among baptist and methodist congregations , whose preachers led the movement . it was past its peak by the late 1840s . it has been described as a reaction against skepticism , deism , and rationalism , although why those forces became pressing enough at the time to spark revivals is not fully understood . it enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations .
the use of the term middle east as a region of international affairs apparently began in british and american diplomatic circles quite independently of each other over concern for the security of the same country : iran , then known to the west as persia . in 1900 thomas edward gordon published an article , the problem of the middle east , which began :
throughout the history of the south slavs , the vernacular , literary , and written languages ( e.g . chakavian , kajkavian , shtokavian ) of the various regions and ethnicities developed and diverged independently . prior to the 19th century , they were collectively called " illyric " , " slavic " , " slavonian " , " bosnian " , " dalmatian " , " serbian " or " croatian " . as such , the term serbo-croatian was first used by jacob grimm in 1824 , popularized by the vienna philologist jernej kopitar in the following decades , and accepted by croatian zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859 . at that time , serb and croat lands were still part of the ottoman and austrian empires . officially , the language was called variously serbo-croat , croato-serbian , serbian and croatian , croatian and serbian , serbian or croatian , croatian or serbian . unofficially , serbs and croats typically called the language " serbian " or " croatian " , respectively , without implying a distinction between the two , and again in independent bosnia and herzegovina , " bosnian " , " croatian " , and " serbian " were considered to be three names of a single official language . croatian linguist dalibor brozović advocated the term serbo-croatian as late as 1988 , claiming that in an analogy with indo-european , serbo-croatian does not only name the two components of the same language , but simply charts the limits of the region in which it is spoken and includes everything between the limits ( ‘ bosnian ’ and ‘ montenegrin ’ ) . today , use of the term " serbo-croatian " is controversial due to the prejudice that nation and language must match . it is still used for lack of a succinct alternative , though alternative names have been used , such as bosnian/croatian/serbian ( bcs ) , which is often seen in political contexts such as the hague war crimes tribunal .
sleep does not affect acquisition or recall while one is awake . therefore , sleep has the greatest effect on memory consolidation . during sleep , the neural connections in the brain are strengthened . this enhances the brain ’ s abilities to stabilize and retain memories . there have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory , as memories are enhanced through active consolidation . system consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep ( sws ) . this process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep , but that the process doesn ’ t enhance every memory . it also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep . when you are sleeping , the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex . the neocortex then reviews and processes memories , which moves them into long-term memory . when you do not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong , resulting in a lower retention rate of memories . sleep deprivation makes it harder to focus , resulting in inefficient learning . furthermore , some studies have shown that sleep deprivation can lead to false memories as the memories are not properly transferred to long-term memory . therefore , it is important to get the proper amount of sleep so that memory can function at the highest level . one of the primary functions of sleep is thought to be the improvement of the consolidation of information , as several studies have demonstrated that memory depends on getting sufficient sleep between training and test . additionally , data obtained from neuroimaging studies have shown activation patterns in the sleeping brain that mirror those recorded during the learning of tasks from the previous day , suggesting that new memories may be solidified through such rehearsal .
argentina : the torch relay leg in buenos aires , argentina , held on april 11 , began with an artistic show at the lola mora amphitheatre in costanera sur . in the end of the show the mayor of buenos aires mauricio macri gave the torch to the first torchbearer , carlos espínola . the leg finished at the buenos aires riding club in the palermo district , the last torchbearer being gabriela sabatini . the 13.8 km route included landmarks like the obelisk and plaza de mayo . the day was marked by several pro-tibet protests , which included a giant banner reading " free tibet " , and an alternative " human rights torch " that was lit by protesters and paraded along the route the flame was to take . most of these protests were peaceful in nature , and the torch was not impeded . chinese immigrants also turned out in support of the games , but only minor scuffles were reported between both groups . runners surrounded by rows of security carried the olympic flame past thousands of jubilant argentines in the most trouble-free torch relay in nearly a week . people showered the parade route with confetti as banks , government offices and businesses took an impromptu half-day holiday for the only latin american stop on the flame 's five-continent journey .
positioned asymmetrically around the south pole and largely south of the antarctic circle , antarctica is the southernmost continent and is surrounded by the southern ocean ; alternatively , it may be considered to be surrounded by the southern pacific , atlantic , and indian oceans , or by the southern waters of the world ocean . it covers more than 14,000,000 km2 ( 5,400,000 sq mi ) , making it the fifth-largest continent , about 1.3 times as large as europe . the coastline measures 17,968 km ( 11,165 mi ) and is mostly characterized by ice formations , as the following table shows :
the kinsey scale , also called the heterosexual-homosexual rating scale , was first published in sexual behavior in the human male ( 1948 ) by alfred kinsey , wardell pomeroy , and clyde martin and also featured in sexual behavior in the human female ( 1953 ) . the scale was developed to combat the assumption at the time that people are either heterosexual or homosexual and that these two types represent antitheses in the sexual world . recognizing that a large portion of population is not completely heterosexual or homosexual and people can experience both heterosexual and homosexual behavior and psychic responses , kinsey et al. , stated :
the passing of the antarctic conservation act ( 1978 ) in the u.s. brought several restrictions to u.s. activity on antarctica . the introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty , as can the extraction of any indigenous species . the overfishing of krill , which plays a large role in the antarctic ecosystem , led officials to enact regulations on fishing . the convention for the conservation of antarctic marine living resources ( ccamlr ) , a treaty that came into force in 1980 , requires that regulations managing all southern ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire antarctic ecosystem . despite these new acts , unregulated and illegal fishing , particularly of patagonian toothfish ( marketed as chilean sea bass in the u.s. ) , remains a serious problem . the illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing , with estimates of 32,000 tonnes ( 35,300 short tons ) in 2000 .
though pesticide regulations differ from country to country , pesticides , and products on which they were used are traded across international borders . to deal with inconsistencies in regulations among countries , delegates to a conference of the united nations food and agriculture organization adopted an international code of conduct on the distribution and use of pesticides in 1985 to create voluntary standards of pesticide regulation for different countries . the code was updated in 1998 and 2002 . the fao claims that the code has raised awareness about pesticide hazards and decreased the number of countries without restrictions on pesticide use .
while the warsaw pact was established as a balance of power or counterweight to nato , there was no direct confrontation between them . instead , the conflict was fought on an ideological basis . both nato and the warsaw pact led to the expansion of military forces and their integration into the respective blocs . the warsaw pact 's largest military engagement was warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia ( with the participation of all pact nations except romania and albania ) . the pact failed to function when the revolutions of 1989 spread through eastern europe , beginning with the solidarity movement in poland and its success in june 1989 .
required attendance at school is 10 years for males and 11 years for females ( 2001 ) . the adult literacy rate is 99.0 % ( 2002 ) . in 2010 , there were 1,918 students who were taught by 109 teachers ( 98 certified and 11 uncertified ) . the teacher-pupil ratio for primary schools in tuvalu is around 1:18 for all schools with the exception of nauti school , which has a teacher-student ratio of 1:27 . nauti school on funafuti is the largest primary in tuvalu with more than 900 students ( 45 percent of the total primary school enrolment ) . the pupil-teacher ratio for tuvalu is low compared to the pacific region ( ratio of 1:29 ) .
as a result of the abolition of serfdom and the availability of education to the native estonian-speaking population , an active estonian nationalist movement developed in the 19th century . [ citation needed ] it began on a cultural level , resulting in the establishment of estonian language literature , theatre and professional music and led on to the formation of the estonian national identity and the age of awakening . among the leaders of the movement were johann voldemar jannsen , jakob hurt and carl robert jakobson .
french cuisine , west indian cuisine , creole cuisine , italian cuisine and asian cuisine are common in st. barthélemy . the island has over 70 restaurants serving many dishes and others are a significant number of gourmet restaurants ; many of the finest restaurants are located in the hotels . there are also a number of snack restaurants which the french call " les snacks " or " les petits creux " which include sandwiches , pizzas and salads . west indian cuisine , steamed vegetables with fresh fish is common ; creole dishes tend to be spicier . the island hosts gastronomic events throughout the year , with dishes such as spring roll of shrimp and bacon , fresh grilled lobster , chinese noodle salad with coconut milk , and grilled beef fillet etc .
roman catholics believe in the immaculate conception of mary , as proclaimed ex cathedra by pope pius ix in 1854 , namely that she was filled with grace from the very moment of her conception in her mother 's womb and preserved from the stain of original sin . the latin rite of the roman catholic church has a liturgical feast by that name , kept on december 8 . orthodox christians reject the immaculate conception dogma principally because their understanding of ancestral sin ( the greek term corresponding to the latin " original sin " ) differs from the augustinian interpretation and that of the roman catholic church .
in several countries , fire safety officials encourage citizens to use the two annual clock shifts as reminders to replace batteries in smoke and carbon monoxide detectors , particularly in autumn , just before the heating and candle season causes an increase in home fires . similar twice-yearly tasks include reviewing and practicing fire escape and family disaster plans , inspecting vehicle lights , checking storage areas for hazardous materials , reprogramming thermostats , and seasonal vaccinations . locations without dst can instead use the first days of spring and autumn as reminders .
the most popular available tourist destinations in myanmar include big cities such as yangon and mandalay ; religious sites in mon state , pindaya , bago and hpa-an ; nature trails in inle lake , kengtung , putao , pyin oo lwin ; ancient cities such as bagan and mrauk-u ; as well as beaches in nabule , ngapali , ngwe-saung , mergui . nevertheless , much of the country is off-limits to tourists , and interactions between foreigners and the people of myanmar , particularly in the border regions , are subject to police scrutiny . they are not to discuss politics with foreigners , under penalty of imprisonment and , in 2001 , the myanmar tourism promotion board issued an order for local officials to protect tourists and limit " unnecessary contact " between foreigners and ordinary burmese people .
the yoga school builds on the samkhya school theory that jñāna ( knowledge ) is a sufficient means to moksha . it suggests that systematic techniques/practice ( personal experimentation ) combined with samkhya 's approach to knowledge is the path to moksha . yoga shares several central ideas with advaita vedanta , with the difference that yoga is a form of experimental mysticism while advaita vedanta is a form of monistic personalism . like advaita vedanta , the yoga school of hindu philosophy states that liberation/freedom in this life is achievable , and this occurs when an individual fully understands and realizes the equivalence of atman ( soul , self ) and brahman .
agriculture is almost entirely dependent on angiosperms , which provide virtually all plant-based food , and also provide a significant amount of livestock feed . of all the families of plants , the poaceae , or grass family ( grains ) , is by far the most important , providing the bulk of all feedstocks ( rice , corn — maize , wheat , barley , rye , oats , pearl millet , sugar cane , sorghum ) . the fabaceae , or legume family , comes in second place . also of high importance are the solanaceae , or nightshade family ( potatoes , tomatoes , and peppers , among others ) , the cucurbitaceae , or gourd family ( also including pumpkins and melons ) , the brassicaceae , or mustard plant family ( including rapeseed and the innumerable varieties of the cabbage species brassica oleracea ) , and the apiaceae , or parsley family . many of our fruits come from the rutaceae , or rue family ( including oranges , lemons , grapefruits , etc . ) , and the rosaceae , or rose family ( including apples , pears , cherries , apricots , plums , etc . ) .
often categorised with the new wave of british heavy metal , in 1981 def leppard released their second album high 'n ' dry , mixing glam-rock with heavy metal , and helping to define the sound of hard rock for the decade . the follow-up pyromania ( 1983 ) , reached number two on the american charts and the singles " photograph " , " rock of ages " and " foolin ' " , helped by the emergence of mtv , all reached the top 40 . it was widely emulated , particularly by the emerging californian glam metal scene . this was followed by us acts like mötley crüe , with their albums too fast for love ( 1981 ) and shout at the devil ( 1983 ) and , as the style grew , the arrival of bands such as ratt , white lion , twisted sister and quiet riot . quiet riot 's album metal health ( 1983 ) was the first glam metal album , and arguably the first heavy metal album of any kind , to reach number one in the billboard music charts and helped open the doors for mainstream success by subsequent bands .
after christianization , the roman catholic church and local rulers led german expansion and settlement in areas inhabited by slavs and balts , known as ostsiedlung . during the wars waged in the baltic by the catholic german teutonic knights ; the lands inhabited by the ethnic group of the old prussians ( the current reference to the people known then simply as the " prussians " ) , were conquered by the germans . the old prussians were an ethnic group related to the latvian and lithuanian baltic peoples . the former german state of prussia took its name from the baltic prussians , although it was led by germans who had assimilated the old prussians ; the old prussian language was extinct by the 17th or early 18th century . the slavic people of the teutonic-controlled baltic were assimilated into german culture and eventually there were many intermarriages of slavic and german families , including amongst the prussia 's aristocracy known as the junkers . prussian military strategist karl von clausewitz is a famous german whose surname is of slavic origin . massive german settlement led to the assimilation of baltic ( old prussians ) and slavic ( wends ) populations , who were exhausted by previous warfare .

most major airports provide commercial outlets for products and services . most of these companies , many of which are internationally known brands , are located within the departure areas . these include clothing boutiques and restaurants . prices charged for items sold at these outlets are generally higher than those outside the airport . however , some airports now regulate costs to keep them comparable to " street prices " . this term is misleading as prices often match the manufacturers ' suggested retail price ( msrp ) but are almost never discounted .

calcutta ( now kolkata ) was the capital of india during the british raj until december 1911 . however , delhi had served as the political and financial centre of several empires of ancient india and the delhi sultanate , most notably of the mughal empire from 1649 to 1857 . during the early 1900s , a proposal was made to the british administration to shift the capital of the british indian empire ( as it was officially called ) from calcutta to delhi . unlike calcutta , which was located on the eastern coast of india , delhi was at the centre of northern india and the government of british india felt that it would be logistically easier to administer india from the latter rather than the former .
child labour is still common in many parts of the world . estimates for child labour vary . it ranges between 250 and 304 million , if children aged 5–17 involved in any economic activity are counted . if light occasional work is excluded , ilo estimates there were 153 million child labourers aged 5–14 worldwide in 2008 . this is about 20 million less than ilo estimate for child labourers in 2004 . some 60 percent of the child labour was involved in agricultural activities such as farming , dairy , fisheries and forestry . another 25 percent of child labourers were in service activities such as retail , hawking goods , restaurants , load and transfer of goods , storage , picking and recycling trash , polishing shoes , domestic help , and other services . the remaining 15 percent laboured in assembly and manufacturing in informal economy , home-based enterprises , factories , mines , packaging salt , operating machinery , and such operations . two out of three child workers work alongside their parents , in unpaid family work situations . some children work as guides for tourists , sometimes combined with bringing in business for shops and restaurants . child labour predominantly occurs in the rural areas ( 70 % ) and informal urban sector ( 26 % ) .
following the 2000 census , the oklahoma delegation to the u.s. house of representatives was reduced from six to five representatives , each serving one congressional district . for the 112th congress ( 2011–2013 ) , there were no changes in party strength , and the delegation included four republicans and one democrat . in the 112th congress , oklahoma 's u.s. senators were republicans jim inhofe and tom coburn , and its u.s . representatives were john sullivan ( r-ok-1 ) , dan boren ( d-ok-2 ) , frank d. lucas ( r-ok-3 ) , tom cole ( r-ok-4 ) , and james lankford ( r-ok-5 ) .
in the early 20th century , the vast conscription of italian men from all throughout italy during world war i is credited with facilitating the diffusion of standard italian among less educated italian men , as these men from various regions with various regional languages were forced to communicate with each other in a common tongue while serving in the italian military . with the eventual spread of the radio and television throughout italy and the establishment of public education , italians from all regions were increasingly exposed to standard italian , while literacy rates among all social classes improved . today , the majority of italians are able to speak standard italian , though many italians still speak their regional language regularly or as their primary day-to-day language , especially at home with family or when communicating with italians from the same town or region . however , to some italians , speaking a regional language , especially in a formal setting or outside of one 's region , may carry a stigma or negative connotations associated with being lower class , uneducated , boorish , or overly informal .
in the early hours of 7 december ( hawaiian time ) , japan launched a major surprise carrier-based air strike on pearl harbor without explicit warning , which crippled the u.s. pacific fleet , leaving eight american battleships out of action , 188 american aircraft destroyed , and 2,403 american citizens dead . at the time of the attack , the u.s. was not officially at war anywhere in the world , which means that the people killed or property destroyed at pearl harbor by the japanese attack had a non-combatant status . [ nb 11 ] the japanese had gambled that the united states , when faced with such a sudden and massive blow , would agree to a negotiated settlement and allow japan free rein in asia . this gamble did not pay off . american losses were less serious than initially thought : the american aircraft carriers , which would prove to be more important than battleships , were at sea , and vital naval infrastructure ( fuel oil tanks , shipyard facilities , and a power station ) , submarine base , and signals intelligence units were unscathed . japan 's fallback strategy , relying on a war of attrition to make the u.s. come to terms , was beyond the ijn 's capabilities .
most airports welcome filming on site , although it must be agreed in advance and may be subject to a fee . landside , filming can take place in all public areas . however airside , filming is heavily restricted , the only airside locations where filming is permitted are the departure lounge and some outside areas . to film in an airside location , all visitors must go through security , the same as passengers , and be accompanied by a full airside pass holder and have their passport with them at all times . filming can not be undertaken in security , at immigration/customs , or in baggage reclaim .
the northwestern library system consists of four libraries on the evanston campus including the present main library , university library and the original library building , deering library ; three libraries on the chicago campus ; and the library affiliated with garrett-evangelical theological seminary . the university library contains over 4.9 million volumes , 4.6 million microforms , and almost 99,000 periodicals making it ( by volume ) the 30th-largest university library in north america and the 10th-largest library among private universities . notable collections in the library system include the melville j. herskovits library of african studies , the largest africana collection in the world , an extensive collection of early edition printed music and manuscripts as well as late-modern works , and an art collection noted for its 19th and 20th-century western art and architecture periodicals . the library system participates with 15 other universities in digitizing its collections as a part of the google book search project . the mary and leigh block museum of art is a major art museum in chicago , containing more than 4,000 works in its permanent collection as well as dedicating a third of its space to temporary and traveling exhibitions .
the solís theatre is uruguay 's oldest theatre . it was built in 1856 and is currently owned by the government of montevideo . in 1998 , the government of montevideo started a major reconstruction of the theatre , which included two us $ 110,000 columns designed by philippe starck . the reconstruction was completed in 2004 , and the theatre reopened in august of that year . the plaza is also the site of the offices of the president of uruguay ( both the estévez palace and the executive tower ) . the artigas mausoleum is located at the centre of the plaza . statues include that of josé gervasio artigas , hero of uruguay 's independence movement ; an honour guard keeps vigil at the mausoleum .
ecclesiam suam was given at st. peter 's , rome , on the feast of the transfiguration , 6 august 1964 , the second year of his pontificate . it is considered an important document , identifying the catholic church with the body of christ . a later council document lumen gentium stated that the church subsists in the body of christ , raising questions as to the difference between " is " and " subsists in " . paul vi appealed to " all people of good will " and discussed necessary dialogues within the church and between the churches and with atheism .
heitaro nakajima , who developed an early digital audio recorder within japan 's national public broadcasting organization nhk in 1970 , became general manager of sony 's audio department in 1971 . his team developed a digital pcm adaptor audio tape recorder using a betamax video recorder in 1973 . after this , in 1974 the leap to storing digital audio on an optical disc was easily made . sony first publicly demonstrated an optical digital audio disc in september 1976 . a year later , in september 1977 , sony showed the press a 30 cm disc that could play 60 minutes of digital audio ( 44,100 hz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution ) using mfm modulation . in september 1978 , the company demonstrated an optical digital audio disc with a 150-minute playing time , 44,056 hz sampling rate , 16-bit linear resolution , and cross-interleaved error correction code—specifications similar to those later settled upon for the standard compact disc format in 1980 . technical details of sony 's digital audio disc were presented during the 62nd aes convention , held on 13–16 march 1979 , in brussels . sony 's aes technical paper was published on 1 march 1979 . a week later , on 8 march , philips publicly demonstrated a prototype of an optical digital audio disc at a press conference called " philips introduce compact disc " in eindhoven , netherlands .

on 15 october 1950 , president truman and general macarthur met at wake island in the mid-pacific ocean . this meeting was much publicized because of the general 's discourteous refusal to meet the president on the continental united states . to president truman , macarthur speculated there was little risk of chinese intervention in korea , and that the prc 's opportunity for aiding the kpa had lapsed . he believed the prc had some 300,000 soldiers in manchuria , and some 100,000–125,000 soldiers at the yalu river . he further concluded that , although half of those forces might cross south , " if the chinese tried to get down to pyongyang , there would be the greatest slaughter " without air force protection .
the u.s. senate passed a reform bill in may 2010 , following the house which passed a bill in december 2009 . these bills must now be reconciled . the new york times provided a comparative summary of the features of the two bills , which address to varying extent the principles enumerated by the obama administration . for instance , the volcker rule against proprietary trading is not part of the legislation , though in the senate bill regulators have the discretion but not the obligation to prohibit these trades .
by the 1890s the profound effect of adrenal extracts on many different tissue types had been discovered , setting off a search both for the mechanism of chemical signalling and efforts to exploit these observations for the development of new drugs . the blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock , and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance . in 1897 john abel of johns hopkins university identified the active principle as epinephrine , which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt . industrial chemist jokichi takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state , and licensed the technology to parke davis . parke davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name adrenalin . injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks , and an inhaled version was sold in the united states until 2011 ( primatene mist ) . by 1929 epinephrine had been formulated into an inhaler for use in the treatment of nasal congestion .
in the increasingly globalized film industry , videoconferencing has become useful as a method by which creative talent in many different locations can collaborate closely on the complex details of film production . for example , for the 2013 award-winning animated film frozen , burbank-based walt disney animation studios hired the new york city-based husband-and-wife songwriting team of robert lopez and kristen anderson-lopez to write the songs , which required two-hour-long transcontinental videoconferences nearly every weekday for about 14 months .
the combined business is expected to address the markets for scale-out architecture , converged infrastructure and private cloud computing , playing to the strengths of both emc and dell . commentators have questioned the deal , with fbr capital markets saying that though it makes a " ton of sense " for dell , it 's a " nightmare scenario that would lack strategic synergies " for emc . fortune said there was a lot for dell to like in emc 's portfolio , but " does it all add up enough to justify tens of billions of dollars for the entire package ? probably not . " the register reported the view of william blair & company that the merger would " blow up the current it chess board " , forcing other it infrastructure vendors to restructure to achieve scale and vertical integration . the value of vmware stock fell 10 % after the announcement , valuing the deal at around $ 63–64bn rather than the $ 67bn originally reported .
other fortune 500 companies , while not headquartered in the area , do have a major presence . these include suntrust bank ( based in atlanta ) , capital one financial corporation ( officially based in mclean , virginia , but founded in richmond with its operations center and most employees in the richmond area ) , and the medical and pharmaceutical giant mckesson ( based in san francisco ) . capital one and altria company 's philip morris usa are two of the largest private richmond-area employers . dupont maintains a production facility in south richmond known as the spruance plant . ups freight , the less-than-truckload division of ups and formerly known as overnite transportation , has its corporate headquarters in richmond .
the usb power delivery revision 2.0 specification has been released as part of the usb 3.1 suite . it covers the type-c cable and connector with four power/ground pairs and a separate configuration channel , which now hosts a dc coupled low-frequency bmc-coded data channel that reduces the possibilities for rf interference . power delivery protocols have been updated to facilitate type-c features such as cable id function , alternate mode negotiation , increased vbus currents , and vconn-powered accessories .
the 2008 summer olympics torch relay was run from march 24 until august 8 , 2008 , prior to the 2008 summer olympics , with the theme of " one world , one dream " . plans for the relay were announced on april 26 , 2007 , in beijing , china . the relay , also called by the organizers as the " journey of harmony " , lasted 129 days and carried the torch 137,000 km ( 85,000 mi ) – the longest distance of any olympic torch relay since the tradition was started ahead of the 1936 summer olympics .
definitions vary on the precise boundaries of the appalachians . the united states geological survey ( usgs ) defines the appalachian highlands physiographic division as consisting of thirteen provinces : the atlantic coast uplands , eastern newfoundland atlantic , maritime acadian highlands , maritime plain , notre dame and mégantic mountains , western newfoundland mountains , piedmont , blue ridge , valley and ridge , saint lawrence valley , appalachian plateaus , new england province , and the adirondack provinces . a common variant definition does not include the adirondack mountains , which geologically belong to the grenville orogeny and have a different geological history from the rest of the appalachians .
section 6 of the endangered species act provided funding for development of programs for management of threatened and endangered species by state wildlife agencies . subsequently , lists of endangered and threatened species within their boundaries have been prepared by each state . these state lists often include species which are considered endangered or threatened within a specific state but not within all states , and which therefore are not included on the national list of endangered and threatened species . examples include florida , minnesota , maine , and california .
as there is no research indicating which of the three components is essential in defining sexual orientation , all three are used independently and provide different conclusions regarding sexual orientation . savin williams ( 2006 ) discusses this issue and notes that by basing findings regarding sexual orientation on a single component , researchers may not actually capture the intended population . for example , if homosexual is defined by same sex behavior , gay virgins are omitted , heterosexuals engaging in same sex behavior for other reasons than preferred sexual arousal are miscounted , and those with same sex attraction who only have opposite-sex relations are excluded . because of the limited populations that each component captures , consumers of research should be cautious in generalizing these findings .
the bibliothèque nationale et universitaire ( bnu ) is , with its collection of more than 3,000,000 titles , the second largest library in france after the bibliothèque nationale de france . it was founded by the german administration after the complete destruction of the previous municipal library in 1871 and holds the unique status of being simultaneously a students ' and a national library . the strasbourg municipal library had been marked erroneously as " city hall " in a french commercial map , which had been captured and used by the german artillery to lay their guns . a librarian from munich later pointed out " ... that the destruction of the precious collection was not the fault of a german artillery officer , who used the french map , but of the slovenly and inaccurate scholarship of a frenchman . "
a census of sea life carried out during the international polar year and which involved some 500 researchers was released in 2010 . the research is part of the global census of marine life ( coml ) and has disclosed some remarkable findings . more than 235 marine organisms live in both polar regions , having bridged the gap of 12,000 km ( 7,456 mi ) . large animals such as some cetaceans and birds make the round trip annually . more surprising are small forms of life such as mudworms , sea cucumbers and free-swimming snails found in both polar oceans . various factors may aid in their distribution – fairly uniform temperatures of the deep ocean at the poles and the equator which differ by no more than 5 °c , and the major current systems or marine conveyor belt which transport eggs and larval stages .
while knickebein was used by german crews en masse , x-gerät use was limited to specially trained pathfinder crews . special receivers were mounted in he 111s , with a radio mast on the bomber 's fuselage . the system worked on a higher frequency ( 66–77 mhz , compared to knickebein 's 30–33 mhz ) . transmitters on the ground sent pulses at a rate of 180 per minute . x-gerät received and analysed the pulses , giving the pilot both visual and aural " on course " signals . three beams intersected the beam along the he 111 's flight path . the first cross-beam acted as a warning for the bomb-aimer to start the bombing-clock which he would activate only when the second cross-beam was reached . when the third cross-beam was reached the bomb aimer activated a third trigger , which stopped the first hand of the equipment 's clock , with the second hand continuing . when the second hand re-aligned with the first , the bombs were released . the clock 's timing mechanism was co-ordinated with the distances of the intersecting beams from the target so the target was directly below when the bomb release occurred .
in 1995 , oklahoma city was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in american history . the oklahoma city bombing of april 19 , 1995 , in which timothy mcveigh and terry nichols detonated an explosive outside of the alfred p. murrah federal building , killed 168 people , including 19 children . the two men were convicted of the bombing : mcveigh was sentenced to death and executed by the federal government on june 11 , 2001 ; his partner nichols is serving a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole . mcveigh 's army buddy , michael fortier , was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison and ordered to pay a $ 75,000 fine for his role in the bombing plot ( i.e . assisting in the sale of guns to raise funds for the bombing , and examining the murrah federal building as a possible target before the terrorist attack ) . his wife , lori fortier , who has since died , was granted immunity from prosecution in return for her testimony in the case .
dismayed to find that groundbreaking work had already been undertaken by helmholtz who had conveyed vowel sounds by means of a similar tuning fork " contraption " , he pored over the german scientist 's book . working from his own erroneous mistranslation of a french edition , bell fortuitously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound , reporting : " without knowing much about the subject , it seemed to me that if vowel sounds could be produced by electrical means , so could consonants , so could articulate speech . " he also later remarked : " i thought that helmholtz had done it ... and that my failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity . it was a valuable blunder ... if i had been able to read german in those days , i might never have commenced my experiments !

greek kanon / ancient greek : κανών , arabic qanun / قانون , hebrew kaneh / קנה , " straight " ; a rule , code , standard , or measure ; the root meaning in all these languages is " reed " ( cf . the romance-language ancestors of the english word " cane " ) .
a " lock-in " is when a pub owner lets drinkers stay in the pub after the legal closing time , on the theory that once the doors are locked , it becomes a private party rather than a pub . patrons may put money behind the bar before official closing time , and redeem their drinks during the lock-in so no drinks are technically sold after closing time . the origin of the british lock-in was a reaction to 1915 changes in the licensing laws in england and wales , which curtailed opening hours to stop factory workers from turning up drunk and harming the war effort . since 1915 , the uk licensing laws had changed very little , with comparatively early closing times . the tradition of the lock-in therefore remained . since the implementation of licensing act 2003 , premises in england and wales may apply to extend their opening hours beyond 11 pm , allowing round-the-clock drinking and removing much of the need for lock-ins . since the smoking ban , some establishments operated a lock-in during which the remaining patrons could smoke without repercussions but , unlike drinking lock-ins , allowing smoking in a pub was still a prosecutable offence .
napoléon bonaparte ( /nəˈpoʊliən , -ˈpoʊljən/ ; french : [ napɔleɔ̃ bɔnapaʁt ] , born napoleone di buonaparte ; 15 august 1769 – 5 may 1821 ) was a french military and political leader who rose to prominence during the french revolution and led several successful campaigns during the revolutionary wars . as napoleon i , he was emperor of the french from 1804 until 1814 , and again in 1815 . napoleon dominated european and global affairs for more than a decade while leading france against a series of coalitions in the napoleonic wars . he won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles , building a large empire that ruled over continental europe before its final collapse in 1815 . often considered one of the greatest commanders in history , his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide . he also remains one of the most celebrated and controversial political figures in western history . in civil affairs , napoleon had a major long-term impact by bringing liberal reforms to the territories that he conquered , especially the low countries , switzerland , and large parts of modern italy and germany . he implemented fundamental liberal policies in france and throughout western europe . [ note 1 ] his lasting legal achievement , the napoleonic code , has been adopted in various forms by a quarter of the world 's legal systems , from japan to quebec .
in a series of famous papers , von neumann made spectacular contributions to measure theory . the work of banach had implied that the problem of measure has a positive solution if n = 1 or n = 2 and a negative solution in all other cases . von neumann 's work argued that the " problem is essentially group-theoretic in character , and that , in particular , for the solvability of the problem of measure the ordinary algebraic concept of solvability of a group is relevant . thus , according to von neumann , it is the change of group that makes a difference , not the change of space . "
victoria married her first cousin , prince albert of saxe-coburg and gotha , in 1840 . their nine children married into royal and noble families across the continent , tying them together and earning her the sobriquet " the grandmother of europe " . after albert 's death in 1861 , victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances . as a result of her seclusion , republicanism temporarily gained strength , but in the latter half of her reign her popularity recovered . her golden and diamond jubilees were times of public celebration .
illustrated humour periodicals were popular in 19th-century britain , the earliest of which was the short-lived the glasgow looking glass in 1825 . the most popular was punch , which popularized the term cartoon for its humorous caricatures . on occasion the cartoons in these magazines appeared in sequences ; the character ally sloper featured in the earliest serialized comic strip when the character began to feature in its own weekly magazine in 1884 .
the city hockey club , southampton hockey club , founded in 1938 , is now one of the largest and highly regarded clubs in hampshire , fielding 7 senior men 's and 5 senior ladies teams on a weekly basis along with boys ’ and girls ’ teams from 6 upwards .
gorbachev 's inability to alleviate any of armenia 's problems created disillusionment among the armenians and fed a growing hunger for independence . in may 1990 , the new armenian army ( naa ) was established , serving as a defence force separate from the soviet red army . clashes soon broke out between the naa and soviet internal security forces ( mvd ) troops based in yerevan when armenians decided to commemorate the establishment of the 1918 first republic of armenia . the violence resulted in the deaths of five armenians killed in a shootout with the mvd at the railway station . witnesses there claimed that the mvd used excessive force and that they had instigated the fighting .
he does not argue that any such conclusions are therefore true , or that this describes the actual methods of any particular scientist . [ citation needed ] rather , it is recommended as an essential principle of methodology that , if enacted by a system or community , will lead to slow but steady progress of a sort ( relative to how well the system or community enacts the method ) . it has been suggested that popper 's ideas are often mistaken for a hard logical account of truth because of the historical co-incidence of their appearing at the same time as logical positivism , the followers of which mistook his aims for their own .
norman plays host to the norman music festival , a festival that highlights native oklahoma bands and musicians . norman is also host to the medieval fair of norman , which has been held annually since 1976 and was oklahoma 's first medieval fair . the fair was held first on the south oval of the university of oklahoma campus and in the third year moved to the duck pond in norman until the fair became too big and moved to reaves park in 2003 . the medieval fair of norman is oklahoma 's " largest weekend event and the third largest event in oklahoma , and was selected by events media network as one of the top 100 events in the nation " .
in recent years it has become common for many ac stations , particularly soft ac stations , to play primarily or exclusively christmas music during the christmas season in november and december . while these tend mostly to be contemporary seasonal recordings by the same few artists featured under the normal format , most stations will also air some vintage holiday tunes from older pop , mor , and adult standards artists – such as nat king cole , bing crosby , dean martin , the carpenters , percy faith , johnny mathis and andy williams – many of whom would never be played on these stations during the rest of the year .
bell 's father was invited by sarah fuller , principal of the boston school for deaf mutes ( which continues today as the public horace mann school for the deaf ) , in boston , massachusetts , to introduce the visible speech system by providing training for fuller 's instructors , but he declined the post in favor of his son . traveling to boston in april 1871 , bell proved successful in training the school 's instructors . he was subsequently asked to repeat the program at the american asylum for deaf-mutes in hartford , connecticut , and the clarke school for the deaf in northampton , massachusetts .
western europe 's largest jewish community , and the third-largest jewish community in the world , can be found in france , home to between 483,000 and 500,000 jews , the majority of whom are immigrants or refugees from north african arab countries such as algeria , morocco , and tunisia ( or their descendants ) . the united kingdom has a jewish community of 292,000 . in eastern europe , there are anywhere from 350,000 to one million jews living in the former soviet union , but exact figures are difficult to establish . in germany , the 102,000 jews registered with the jewish community are a slowly declining population , despite the immigration of tens of thousands of jews from the former soviet union since the fall of the berlin wall . thousands of israelis also live in germany , either permanently or temporarily , for economic reasons .
diaz 's plans called for the entire city to eventually be modernized or rebuilt in the porfirian/french style of the colonia roma ; but the mexican revolution began soon afterward and the plans never came to fruition , with many projects being left half-completed . one of the best examples of this is the monument to the mexican revolution . originally the monument was to be the main dome of diaz 's new senate hall , but when the revolution erupted only the dome of the senate hall and its supporting pillars were completed , this was subsequently seen as a symbol by many mexicans that the porfirian era was over once and for all and as such , it was turned into a monument to victory over diaz .
a dramatic example of the effect of food processing on a population 's health is the history of epidemics of beri-beri in people subsisting on polished rice . removing the outer layer of rice by polishing it removes with it the essential vitamin thiamine , causing beri-beri . another example is the development of scurvy among infants in the late 19th century in the united states . it turned out that the vast majority of sufferers were being fed milk that had been heat-treated ( as suggested by pasteur ) to control bacterial disease . pasteurisation was effective against bacteria , but it destroyed the vitamin c .
the final major aspect of identity formation is self-esteem . self-esteem is defined as one 's thoughts and feelings about one 's self-concept and identity . most theories on self-esteem state that there is a grand desire , across all genders and ages , to maintain , protect and enhance their self-esteem . contrary to popular belief , there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence . " barometric self-esteem " fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety , but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence . the validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned , and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience . girls are most likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends , the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support . when they fail to win friends ' approval or could n't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests , in these cases , girls suffer from low self-esteem . in contrast , boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority . as such , they are more likely to derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends ; on the other hand , the lack of romantic competence , for example , failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex ( depending on sexual orientation ) , is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys . due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship , they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state . depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide ( mearns , 1991 ; ustun & sartorius , 1995 ) .
over 90 weeklies , fortnightlies and quarterlies are published in sanskrit . sudharma , a daily newspaper in sanskrit , has been published out of mysore , india , since 1970 , while sanskrit vartman patram and vishwasya vrittantam started in gujarat during the last five years . since 1974 , there has been a short daily news broadcast on state-run all india radio . these broadcasts are also made available on the internet on air 's website . sanskrit news is broadcast on tv and on the internet through the dd national channel at 6:55 am ist .
according to author michael carrithers , while there are good reasons to doubt the traditional account , " the outline of the life must be true : birth , maturity , renunciation , search , awakening and liberation , teaching , death . " in writing her biography of the buddha , karen armstrong noted , " it is obviously difficult , therefore , to write a biography of the buddha that meets modern criteria , because we have very little information that can be considered historically sound ... [ but ] we can be reasonably confident siddhatta gotama did indeed exist and that his disciples preserved the memory of his life and teachings as well as they could . " [ dubious – discuss ]
jehovah 's witnesses believe that jesus is god 's only direct creation , that everything else was created by means of christ , and that the initial unassisted act of creation uniquely identifies jesus as god 's " only-begotten son " . jesus served as a redeemer and a ransom sacrifice to pay for the sins of humanity . they believe jesus died on a single upright post rather than the traditional cross . they believe that references in the bible to the archangel michael , abaddon ( apollyon ) , and the word all refer to jesus . jesus is considered to be the only intercessor and high priest between god and humanity , and appointed by god as the king and judge of his kingdom . his role as a mediator ( referred to in 1 timothy 2:5 ) is applied to the 'anointed ' class , though the 'other sheep ' are said to also benefit from the arrangement .
polemics about humanism have sometimes assumed paradoxical twists and turns . early 20th century critics such as ezra pound , t. e. hulme , and t. s. eliot considered humanism to be sentimental " slop " ( hulme ) [ citation needed ] or " an old bitch gone in the teeth " ( pound ) and wanted to go back to a more manly , authoritarian society such as ( they believed ) existed in the middle ages . postmodern critics who are self-described anti-humanists , such as jean-françois lyotard and michel foucault , have asserted that humanism posits an overarching and excessively abstract notion of humanity or universal human nature , which can then be used as a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human . " humanism fabricates the human as much as it fabricates the nonhuman animal " , suggests timothy laurie , turning the human into what he calls " a placeholder for a range of attributes that have been considered most virtuous among humans ( e.g . rationality , altruism ) , rather than most commonplace ( e.g . hunger , anger ) " . nevertheless , philosopher kate soper notes that by faulting humanism for falling short of its own benevolent ideals , anti-humanism thus frequently " secretes a humanist rhetoric " .
bacteria do not have a membrane-bound nucleus , and their genetic material is typically a single circular dna chromosome located in the cytoplasm in an irregularly shaped body called the nucleoid . the nucleoid contains the chromosome with its associated proteins and rna . the phylum planctomycetes and candidate phylum poribacteria may be exceptions to the general absence of internal membranes in bacteria , because they appear to have a double membrane around their nucleoids and contain other membrane-bound cellular structures . like all living organisms , bacteria contain ribosomes , often grouped in chains called polyribosomes , for the production of proteins , but the structure of the bacterial ribosome is different from that of eukaryotes and archaea . bacterial ribosomes have a sedimentation rate of 70s ( measured in svedberg units ) : their subunits have rates of 30s and 50s . some antibiotics bind specifically to 70s ribosomes and inhibit bacterial protein synthesis . those antibiotics kill bacteria without affecting the larger 80s ribosomes of eukaryotic cells and without harming the host .
domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors , sensory capabilities , and physical attributes . modern dog breeds show more variation in size , appearance , and behavior than any other domestic animal . dogs are predators and scavengers , and like many other predatory mammals , the dog has powerful muscles , fused wrist bones , a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance , and teeth for catching and tearing .
a major problem in the managing of the luftwaffe was hermann göring . hitler believed the luftwaffe was " the most effective strategic weapon " , and in reply to repeated requests from the kriegsmarine for control over aircraft insisted , " we should never have been able to hold our own in this war if we had not had an undivided luftwaffe " . such principles made it much harder to integrate the air force into the overall strategy and produced in göring a jealous and damaging defence of his " empire " while removing hitler voluntarily from the systematic direction of the luftwaffe at either the strategic or operational level . when hitler tried to intervene more in the running of the air force later in the war , he was faced with a political conflict of his own making between himself and göring , which was not fully resolved until the war was almost over . in 1940 and 1941 , göring 's refusal to cooperate with the kriegsmarine denied the entire wehrmacht military forces of the reich the chance to strangle british sea communications , which might have had strategic or decisive effect in the war against the british empire .
the sun had the largest circulation of any daily newspaper in the united kingdom , but in late 2013 slipped to second largest saturday newspaper behind the daily mail . it had an average daily circulation of 2.2 million copies in march 2014 . between july and december 2013 the paper had an average daily readership of approximately 5.5 million , with approximately 31 % of those falling into the abc1 demographic and 68 % in the c2de demographic . approximately 41 % of readers are women . the sun has been involved in many controversies in its history , including its coverage of the 1989 hillsborough football stadium disaster . regional editions of the newspaper for scotland , northern ireland and the republic of ireland are published in glasgow ( the scottish sun ) , belfast ( the sun ) and dublin ( the irish sun ) respectively .
gay and lesbian people can have sexual relationships with someone of the opposite sex for a variety of reasons , including the desire for a perceived traditional family and concerns of discrimination and religious ostracism . while some lgbt people hide their respective orientations from their spouses , others develop positive gay and lesbian identities while maintaining successful heterosexual marriages . coming out of the closet to oneself , a spouse of the opposite sex , and children can present challenges that are not faced by gay and lesbian people who are not married to people of the opposite sex or do not have children .
there are certain characteristics of adolescent development that are more rooted in culture than in human biology or cognitive structures . culture has been defined as the " symbolic and behavioral inheritance received from the past that provides a community framework for what is valued " . culture is learned and socially shared , and it affects all aspects of an individual 's life . social responsibilities , sexual expression , and belief system development , for instance , are all things that are likely to vary by culture . furthermore , distinguishing characteristics of youth , including dress , music and other uses of media , employment , art , food and beverage choices , recreation , and language , all constitute a youth culture . for these reasons , culture is a prevalent and powerful presence in the lives of adolescents , and therefore we can not fully understand today 's adolescents without studying and understanding their culture . however , " culture " should not be seen as synonymous with nation or ethnicity . many cultures are present within any given country and racial or socioeconomic group . furthermore , to avoid ethnocentrism , researchers must be careful not to define the culture 's role in adolescence in terms of their own cultural beliefs .
education remained mostly focused on the training of future clergy . the basic learning of the letters and numbers remained the province of the family or a village priest , but the secondary subjects of the trivium—grammar , rhetoric , logic—were studied in cathedral schools or in schools provided by cities . commercial secondary schools spread , and some italian towns had more than one such enterprise . universities also spread throughout europe in the 14th and 15th centuries . lay literacy rates rose , but were still low ; one estimate gave a literacy rate of ten per cent of males and one per cent of females in 1500 .
according to conservation of energy , energy can neither be created ( produced ) nor destroyed by itself . it can only be transformed . the total inflow of energy into a system must equal the total outflow of energy from the system , plus the change in the energy contained within the system . energy is subject to a strict global conservation law ; that is , whenever one measures ( or calculates ) the total energy of a system of particles whose interactions do not depend explicitly on time , it is found that the total energy of the system always remains constant .
in order not to let the routine administration take over the running of the empire , the qing emperors made sure that all important matters were decided in the " inner court , " which was dominated by the imperial family and manchu nobility and which was located in the northern part of the forbidden city . the core institution of the inner court was the grand council . [ g ] it emerged in the 1720s under the reign of the yongzheng emperor as a body charged with handling qing military campaigns against the mongols , but it soon took over other military and administrative duties and served to centralize authority under the crown . the grand councillors [ h ] served as a sort of privy council to the emperor .
during a panel discussion at harvard university 's reunion for african american alumni during the 2003–04 academic year , two prominent black professors at the institution—lani guinier and henry louis gates—pointed out an unintended effect of affirmative action policies at harvard . they stated that only about a third of black harvard undergraduates were from families in which all four grandparents were born into the african american community . the majority of black students at harvard were caribbean and african immigrants or their children , with some others the mixed-race children of biracial couples . one harvard student , born in the south bronx to a black family whose ancestors have been in the united states for multiple generations , said that there were so few harvard students from the historic african american community that they took to calling themselves " the descendants " ( i.e. , descendants of american slaves ) . the reasons for this underrepresentation of historic african americans , and possible remedies , remain a subject of debate .
from the fifth-generation ipod on , apple introduced a user-configurable volume limit in response to concerns about hearing loss . users report that in the sixth-generation ipod , the maximum volume output level is limited to 100 db in eu markets . apple previously had to remove ipods from shelves in france for exceeding this legal limit . however , users that have bought a new sixth-generation ipod in late 2013 have reported a new option that allowed them to disable the eu volume limit . it has been said that these new ipods came with an updated software that allowed this change . older sixth-generation ipods , however , are unable to update to this software version .
new york is also a major center for non-commercial educational media . the oldest public-access television channel in the united states is the manhattan neighborhood network , founded in 1971 . wnet is the city 's major public television station and a primary source of national public broadcasting service ( pbs ) television programming . wnyc , a public radio station owned by the city until 1997 , has the largest public radio audience in the united states .
time has historically been closely related with space , the two together merging into spacetime in einstein 's special relativity and general relativity . according to these theories , the concept of time depends on the spatial reference frame of the observer , and the human perception as well as the measurement by instruments such as clocks are different for observers in relative motion . for example , if a spaceship carrying a clock flies through space at ( very nearly ) the speed of light , its crew does not notice a change in the speed of time on board their vessel because everything traveling at the same speed slows down at the same rate ( including the clock , the crew 's thought processes , and the functions of their bodies ) . however , to a stationary observer watching the spaceship fly by , the spaceship appears flattened in the direction it is traveling and the clock on board the spaceship appears to move very slowly .
the earliest recorded account of a circadian process dates from the 4th century b.c.e. , when androsthenes , a ship captain serving under alexander the great , described diurnal leaf movements of the tamarind tree . the observation of a circadian or diurnal process in humans is mentioned in chinese medical texts dated to around the 13th century , including the noon and midnight manual and the mnemonic rhyme to aid in the selection of acu-points according to the diurnal cycle , the day of the month and the season of the year .
brasília is known as a departing point for the practice of unpowered air sports , sports that may be practiced with hang gliding or paragliding wings . practitioners of such sports reveal that , because of the city 's dry weather , the city offers strong thermal winds and great " cloud-streets " , which is also the name for a manoeuvre quite appreciated by practitioners . in 2003 , brasília hosted the 14th hang gliding world championship , one of the categories of free flying . in august 2005 , the city hosted the 2nd stage of the brazilian hang gliding championship .
some of the greatest imports to plymouth from the americas and europe during the latter half of the 19th century included maize , wheat , barley , sugar cane , guano , sodium nitrate and phosphate aside from the dockyard in the town of devonport , industries in plymouth such as the gasworks , the railways and tramways and a number of small chemical works had begun to develop in the 19th century , continuing into the 20th century .
in june 1940 , a german prisoner of war was overheard boasting that the british would never find the knickebein , even though it was under their noses . the details of the conversation were passed to an raf air staff technical advisor , dr. r. v. jones , who started an in-depth investigation which discovered that the luftwaffe 's lorenz receivers were more than blind-landing devices . jones therefore began a search for the german beams . avro ansons of the beam approach training development unit ( batdu ) were flown up and down britain fitted with a 30 mhz receiver to detect them . soon a beam was traced to derby ( which had been mentioned in luftwaffe transmissions ) . the first jamming operations were carried out using requisitioned hospital electrocautery machines . a subtle form of distortion was introduced . up to nine special transmitters directed their signals at the beams in a manner that widened its path , negating its ability to accurately locate targets . confidence in the device was diminished by the time the luftwaffe decided to launch large-scale raids . the counter operations were carried out by british electronic counter measures ( ecm ) units under wing commander edward addison , no . 80 wing raf . the production of false radio navigation signals by re-transmitting the originals was a technique known as masking beacons ( meacons ) .
the mid-1970s saw the introduction of dbx-encoded records , again for the audiophile niche market . these were completely incompatible with standard record playback preamplifiers , relying on the dbx compandor encoding/decoding scheme to greatly increase dynamic range ( dbx encoded disks were recorded with the dynamic range compressed by a factor of two in db : quiet sounds were meant to be played back at low gain and loud sounds were meant to be played back at high gain , via automatic gain control in the playback equipment ; this reduced the effect of surface noise on quiet passages ) . a similar and very short-lived scheme involved using the cbs-developed " cx " noise reduction encoding/decoding scheme .
the doctrine of the last day and eschatology ( the final fate of the universe ) may be reckoned as the second great doctrine of the quran . it is estimated that approximately one-third of the quran is eschatological , dealing with the afterlife in the next world and with the day of judgment at the end of time . there is a reference to the afterlife on most pages of the quran and belief in the afterlife is often referred to in conjunction with belief in god as in the common expression : " believe in god and the last day " . a number of suras such as 44 , 56 , 75 , 78 , 81 and 101 are directly related to the afterlife and its preparations . some suras indicate the closeness of the event and warn people to be prepared for the imminent day . for instance , the first verses of sura 22 , which deal with the mighty earthquake and the situations of people on that day , represent this style of divine address : " o people ! be respectful to your lord . the earthquake of the hour is a mighty thing . "
the word " insect " comes from the latin word insectum , meaning " with a notched or divided body " , or literally " cut into " , from the neuter singular perfect passive participle of insectare , " to cut into , to cut up " , from in- " into " and secare " to cut " ; because insects appear " cut into " three sections . pliny the elder introduced the latin designation as a loan-translation of the greek word ἔντομος ( éntomos ) or " insect " ( as in entomology ) , which was aristotle 's term for this class of life , also in reference to their " notched " bodies . " insect " first appears documented in english in 1601 in holland 's translation of pliny . translations of aristotle 's term also form the usual word for " insect " in welsh ( trychfil , from trychu " to cut " and mil , " animal " ) , serbo-croatian ( zareznik , from rezati , " to cut " ) , russian ( насекомое nasekomoje , from seč'/-sekat ' , " to cut " ) , etc .
dst 's potential to save energy comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting , which consumes about 3.5 % of electricity in the united states and canada . delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light in the evening and increases it in the morning . as franklin 's 1784 satire pointed out , lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase , as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise . an early goal of dst was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting , which used to be a primary use of electricity . although energy conservation remains an important goal , energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then , and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results . electricity use is greatly affected by geography , climate , and economics , making it hard to generalize from single studies .
southern europe 's flora is that of the mediterranean region , one of the phytochoria recognized by armen takhtajan . the mediterranean and submediterranean climate regions in europe are found in much of southern europe , mainly in southern portugal , most of spain , the southern coast of france , italy , the croatian coast , much of bosnia , montenegro , albania , macedonia , greece , and the mediterranean islands .
on 19 november 1968 , following progressive economic decline , the keïta regime was overthrown in a bloodless military coup led by moussa traoré , a day which is now commemorated as liberation day . the subsequent military-led regime , with traoré as president , attempted to reform the economy . his efforts were frustrated by political turmoil and a devastating drought between 1968 to 1974 , in which famine killed thousands of people . the traoré regime faced student unrest beginning in the late 1970s and three coup attempts . the traoré regime repressed all dissenters until the late 1980s .
the movement to translate english and european texts transformed the arabic and ottoman turkish languages , and new words , simplified syntax , and directness came to be valued over the previous convolutions . educated arabs and turks in the new professions and the modernized civil service expressed skepticism , writes christopher de bellaigue , " with a freedom that is rarely witnessed today ... . no longer was legitimate knowledge defined by texts in the religious schools , interpreted for the most part with stultifying literalness . it had come to include virtually any intellectual production anywhere in the world . " one of the neologisms that , in a way , came to characterize the infusion of new ideas via translation was " darwiniya " , or " darwinism " .
during most of the war , the un navies patrolled the west and east coasts of north korea , sinking supply and ammunition ships and denying the north koreans the ability to resupply from the sea . aside from very occasional gunfire from north korean shore batteries , the main threat to united states and un navy ships was from magnetic mines . during the war , five u.s. navy ships were lost to mines : two minesweepers , two minesweeper escorts , and one ocean tug . mines and gunfire from north korean coastal artillery damaged another 87 u.s. warships , resulting in slight to moderate damage .

the ptolemaic kingdom was a powerful hellenistic state , extending from southern syria in the east , to cyrene to the west , and south to the frontier with nubia . alexandria became the capital city and a centre of greek culture and trade . to gain recognition by the native egyptian populace , they named themselves as the successors to the pharaohs . the later ptolemies took on egyptian traditions , had themselves portrayed on public monuments in egyptian style and dress , and participated in egyptian religious life .
after the three-year transition period ended with nasser 's official assumption of power , his domestic and independent foreign policies increasingly collided with the regional interests of the uk and france . the latter condemned his strong support for algerian independence , and the uk 's eden government was agitated by nasser 's campaign against the baghdad pact . in addition , nasser 's adherence to neutralism regarding the cold war , recognition of communist china , and arms deal with the eastern bloc alienated the united states . on 19 july 1956 , the us and uk abruptly withdrew their offer to finance construction of the aswan dam , citing concerns that egypt 's economy would be overwhelmed by the project .
15th street starts at fdr drive , and 16th street starts at a dead end half way between fdr drive and avenue c. they are both stopped at avenue c and continue from first avenue to west street , stopped again at union square , and 16th street also pauses at stuyvesant square .
the popular sports in tuvalu include kilikiti , ano , football , futsal , volleyball , handball , basketball and rugby union . tuvalu has sports organisations for athletics , badminton , tennis , table tennis , volleyball , football , basketball , rugby union , weightlifting and powerlifting . at the 2013 pacific mini games , tuau lapua lapua won tuvalu 's first gold medal in an international competition in the weightlifting 62 kilogram male snatch . ( he also won bronze in the clean and jerk , and obtained the silver medal overall for the combined event . ) in 2015 telupe iosefa received the first gold medal won by tuvalu at the pacific games in the powerlifting 120 kg male division .
the island was administered as an extension of virginia by the company until 1614 . its spin-off , the somers isles company , took over in 1615 and managed the colony until 1684 . at that time , the company 's charter was revoked , and the english crown took over administration . the islands became a british colony following the 1707 unification of the parliaments of scotland and england , which created the kingdom of great britain . after 1949 , when newfoundland became part of canada , bermuda was automatically ranked as the oldest remaining british overseas territory . since the return of hong kong to china in 1997 , it is the most populous territory . its first capital , st. george 's , was established in 1612 and is the oldest continuously inhabited english town in the new world .
although chinese characters in vietnam are now limited to ceremonial uses , they were once in widespread use . until the early 20th century , literary chinese was used in vietnam for all official and scholarly writing . around the 13th century the nôm script was developed to record folk literature in the vietnamese language . the script used chinese characters to represent both borrowed sino-vietnamese vocabulary and native words with similar pronunciation or meaning . in addition thousands of new compound characters were created to write vietnamese words . this process resulted in a highly complex system that was never mastered by more than 5 % of the population . both literary chinese and nôm were replaced in the early 20th century by vietnamese written with the latin-based vietnamese alphabet .
in the dicotyledons , the bundles in the very young stem are arranged in an open ring , separating a central pith from an outer cortex . in each bundle , separating the xylem and phloem , is a layer of meristem or active formative tissue known as cambium . by the formation of a layer of cambium between the bundles ( interfascicular cambium ) , a complete ring is formed , and a regular periodical increase in thickness results from the development of xylem on the inside and phloem on the outside . the soft phloem becomes crushed , but the hard wood persists and forms the bulk of the stem and branches of the woody perennial . owing to differences in the character of the elements produced at the beginning and end of the season , the wood is marked out in transverse section into concentric rings , one for each season of growth , called annual rings .
hydrogen is commonly used in power stations as a coolant in generators due to a number of favorable properties that are a direct result of its light diatomic molecules . these include low density , low viscosity , and the highest specific heat and thermal conductivity of all gases .
plant ecology is the science of the functional relationships between plants and their habitats—the environments where they complete their life cycles . plant ecologists study the composition of local and regional floras , their biodiversity , genetic diversity and fitness , the adaptation of plants to their environment , and their competitive or mutualistic interactions with other species . the goals of plant ecology are to understand the causes of their distribution patterns , productivity , environmental impact , evolution , and responses to environmental change .
letter case is often prescribed by the grammar of a language or by the conventions of a particular discipline . in orthography , the uppercase is primarily reserved for special purposes , such as the first letter of a sentence or of a proper noun , which makes the lowercase the more common variant in text . in mathematics , letter case may indicate the relationship between objects with uppercase letters often representing " superior " objects ( e.g . x could be a set containing the generic member x ) . engineering design drawings are typically labelled entirely in upper-case letters , which are easier to distinguish than lowercase , especially when space restrictions require that the lettering be small .
ibm 's employee management practices can be traced back to its roots . in 1914 , ceo thomas j. watson boosted company spirit by creating employee sports teams , hosting family outings , and furnishing a company band . ibm sports teams still continue in the present day ; the ibm big blue continue to exist as semi-professional company rugby and american football teams . in 1924 the quarter century club , which recognizes employees with 25 years of service , was organized and the first issue of business machines , ibm 's internal publication , was published . in 1925 , the first meeting of the hundred percent club , composed of ibm salesmen who meet their quotas , convened in atlantic city , new jersey .
regular script typefaces are also commonly used , but not as common as ming or sans-serif typefaces for body text . regular script typefaces are often used to teach students chinese characters , and often aim to match the standard forms of the region where they are meant to be used . most typefaces in the song dynasty were regular script typefaces which resembled a particular person 's handwriting ( e.g . the handwriting of ouyang xun , yan zhenqing , or liu gongquan ) , while most modern regular script typefaces tend toward anonymity and regularity .
the defence estate is divided as training areas & ranges ( 84.0 % ) , research & development ( 5.4 % ) , airfields ( 3.4 % ) , barracks & camps ( 2.5 % ) , storage & supply depots ( 1.6 % ) , and other ( 3.0 % ) . these are largely managed by the defence infrastructure organisation .
before emerging as a pop star , madonna has spent her early years in rock music alongside her bands , breakfast club and emmy . while performing with emmy , madonna recorded about 12-14 songs which resemble the punk rock of that period . her early rock roots also can be found on the demo album pre-madonna . stephen thomas erlewine noted that with her self-titled debut album , madonna began her career as a disco diva , in an era that did not have any such divas to speak of . in the beginning of the '80 's , disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop , and according to erlewine , madonna had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music . the album 's songs reveal several key trends that have continued to define her success , including a strong dance-based idiom , catchy hooks , highly polished arrangements and madonna 's own vocal style . her second album , like a virgin ( 1984 ) , foreshadowed several trends in her later works . it contained references to classical works ( pizzicato synthesizer line that opens " angel " ) ; potential negative reaction from social groups ( " dress you up " was blacklisted by the parents music resource center ) ; and retro styles ( " shoo-bee-doo " , madonna 's homage to motown ) .
devise minority party strategies . the minority leader , in consultation with other party colleagues , has a range of strategic options that he or she can employ to advance minority party objectives . the options selected depend on a wide range of circumstances , such as the visibility or significance of the issue and the degree of cohesion within the majority party . for instance , a majority party riven by internal dissension , as occurred during the early 1900s when progressive and " regular " republicans were at loggerheads , may provide the minority leader with greater opportunities to achieve his or her priorities than if the majority party exhibited high degrees of party cohesion . among the variable strategies available to the minority party , which can vary from bill to bill and be used in combination or at different stages of the lawmaking process , are the following :
politically , calvin favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy . he appreciated the advantages of democracy : " it is an invaluable gift , if god allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords . " calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against god . to further protect the rights of ordinary people , calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances ( separation of powers ) . thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy . besides england , the netherlands were , under calvinist leadership , the freest country in europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . it granted asylum to philosophers like baruch spinoza and pierre bayle . hugo grotius was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the bible .
in 1914 , claridge 's company entered into a joint venture to produce tar-bound macadam , with materials manufactured through a subsidiary company called clarmac roads ltd. two products resulted , namely clarmac , and clarphalte , with the former being manufactured by clarmac roads and the latter by claridge 's patent asphalte co. , although clarmac was more widely used . [ note 1 ] however , the first world war impacted financially on the clarmac company , which entered into liquidation in 1915 . the failure of clarmac roads ltd had a flow-on effect to claridge 's company , which was itself compulsorily wound up , ceasing operations in 1917 , having invested a substantial amount of funds into the new venture , both at the outset , and in a subsequent attempt to save the clarmac company .
in addition there are two service bells , cast by robert mot , in 1585 and 1598 respectively , a sanctus bell cast in 1738 by richard phelps and thomas lester and two unused bells—one cast about 1320 , by the successor to r de wymbish , and a second cast in 1742 , by thomas lester . the two service bells and the 1320 bell , along with a fourth small silver " dish bell " , kept in the refectory , have been noted as being of historical importance by the church buildings council of the church of england .
the scope of the term " post-punk " has been subject to controversy . while some critics , such as allmusic 's stephen thomas erlewine , have employed the term " post-punk " to denote " a more adventurous and arty form of punk " , others have suggested it pertains to a set of artistic sensibilities and approaches rather than any unifying style . music journalist and post-punk scholar simon reynolds has advocated that post-punk be conceived as " less a genre of music than a space of possibility " , suggesting that " what unites all this activity is a set of open-ended imperatives : innovation ; willful oddness ; the willful jettisoning of all things precedented or 'rock'n'roll ' " . nicholas lezard , problematizing the categorization of post-punk as a genre , described the movement as " so multifarious that only the broadest use of the term is possible " .
orthodox judaism collectively considers itself the only true heir to the jewish tradition . the orthodox jewish movements consider all non-orthodox jewish movements to be unacceptable deviations from authentic judaism ; both because of other denominations ' doubt concerning the verbal revelation of written and oral torah , and because of their rejection of halakhic precedent as binding . as such , orthodox jewish groups characterize non-orthodox forms of judaism as heretical ; see the article on relationships between jewish religious movements .
in 2009 , the university 's marriott school of management received a no . 5 ranking by businessweek for its undergraduate programs , and its mba program was ranked by several sources : no . 22 ranking by businessweek , no . 16 by forbes , and no . 29 by u.s. news & world report . among regional schools the mba program was ranked no . 1 by the wall street journal 's most recent ranking ( 2007 ) , and it was ranked no . 92 among business schools worldwide in 2009 by financial times . for 2009 , the university 's school of accountancy , which is housed within the marriott school , received two no . 3 rankings for its undergraduate program—one by public accounting report and the other by u.s. news & world report . the same two reporting agencies also ranked the school 's macc program no . 3 and no . 8 in the nation , respectively . in 2010 , an article in the wall street journal listing institutions whose graduates were the top-rated by recruiters ranked byu no . 11 . using 2010 fiscal year data , the association of university technology managers ranked byu no . 3 in an evaluation of universities creating the most startup companies through campus research .
politically , the paper 's stance was less clear under prime minister gordon brown who succeeded blair in june 2007 . its editorials were critical of many of brown 's policies and often more supportive of those of conservative leader david cameron . rupert murdoch , head of the sun 's parent company news corporation , speaking at a 2007 meeting with the house of lords select committee on communications , which was investigating media ownership and the news , said that he acts as a " traditional proprietor " . this means he exercises editorial control on major issues such as which political party to back in a general election or which policy to adopt on europe .
in the 5th-century ravenna , the capital of the western roman empire , became the center of late roman mosaic art . the mausoleum of galla placidia was decorated with mosaics of high artistic quality in 425–430 . the vaults of the small , cross-shaped structure are clad with mosaics on blue background . the central motif above the crossing is a golden cross in the middle of the starry sky . another great building established by galla placidia was the church of san giovanni evangelista . she erected it in fulfillment of a vow that she made having escaped from a deadly storm in 425 on the sea voyage from constantinople to ravenna . the mosaics depicted the storm , portraits of members of the western and eastern imperial family and the bishop of ravenna , peter chrysologus . they are known only from renaissance sources because almost all were destroyed in 1747 .
the exeter to plymouth railway of the lswr needs to be reopened to connect cornwall and plymouth to the rest of the uk railway system on an all weather basis . there are proposals to reopen the line from tavistock to bere alston for a through service to plymouth . on the night of 4 february 2014 , amid high winds and extremely rough seas , part of the sea wall at dawlish was breached washing away around 40 metres ( 130 ft ) of the wall and the ballast under the railway immediately behind . the line was closed . network rail began repair work and the line reopened on 4 april 2014 . in the wake of widespread disruption caused by damage to the mainline track at dawlish by coastal storms in february 2014 , network rail are considering reopening the tavistock to okehampton and exeter section of the line as an alternative to the coastal route .
ann arbor 's residential neighborhoods contain architectural styles ranging from classic 19th-century and early-20th-century designs to ranch-style houses . among these homes are a number of kit houses built in the early 20th century . contemporary-style houses are farther from the downtown district . surrounding the university of michigan campus are houses and apartment complexes occupied primarily by student renters . tower plaza , a 26-story condominium building located between the university of michigan campus and downtown , is the tallest building in ann arbor . the 19th-century buildings and streetscape of the old west side neighborhood have been preserved virtually intact ; in 1972 , the district was listed on the national register of historic places , and it is further protected by city ordinances and a nonprofit preservation group .
1762 brought two new countries into the war . britain declared war against spain on 4 january 1762 ; spain reacted by issuing their own declaration of war against britain on 18 january . portugal followed by joining the war on britain 's side . spain , aided by the french , launched an invasion of portugal and succeeded in capturing almeida . the arrival of british reinforcements stalled a further spanish advance , and the battle of valencia de alcántara saw british-portuguese forces overrun a major spanish supply base . the invaders were stopped on the heights in front of abrantes ( called the pass to lisbon ) where the anglo-portuguese were entrenched . eventually the anglo-portuguese army , aided by guerrillas and practicing a scorched earth strategy , chased the greatly reduced franco-spanish army back to spain , recovering almost all the lost towns , among them the spanish headquarters in castelo branco full of wounded and sick that had been left behind .
ranthambore national park is known worldwide for its tiger population and is considered by both wilderness lovers and photographers as one of the best place in india to spot tigers . at one point , due to poaching and negligence , tigers became extinct at sariska , but five tigers have been relocated there . prominent among the wildlife sanctuaries are mount abu sanctuary , bhensrod garh sanctuary , darrah sanctuary , jaisamand sanctuary , kumbhalgarh wildlife sanctuary , jawahar sagar sanctuary , and sita mata wildlife sanctuary .
at the time of the roman empire , about two thousand years ago , various tribes , which spoke celtic dialects of the insular celtic group , were inhabiting the islands . the romans expanded their civilisation to control southern great britain but were impeded in advancing any further , building hadrian 's wall to mark the northern frontier of their empire in 122 ad . at that time , ireland was populated by a people known as hiberni , the northern third or so of great britain by a people known as picts and the southern two thirds by britons .
as an important railroad and road junction and production center , hanover was a major target for strategic bombing during world war ii , including the oil campaign . targets included the afa ( stöcken ) , the deurag-nerag refinery ( misburg ) , the continental plants ( vahrenwald and limmer ) , the united light metal works ( vlw ) in ricklingen and laatzen ( today hanover fairground ) , the hanover/limmer rubber reclamation plant , the hanomag factory ( linden ) and the tank factory m.n.h . maschinenfabrik niedersachsen ( badenstedt ) . forced labourers were sometimes used from the hannover-misburg subcamp of the neuengamme concentration camp . residential areas were also targeted , and more than 6,000 civilians were killed by the allied bombing raids . more than 90 % of the city center was destroyed in a total of 88 bombing raids . after the war , the aegidienkirche was not rebuilt and its ruins were left as a war memorial .
this constitution was created when the u.s. congress directed local government to organize a constitutional convention to write the puerto rico constitution in 1951 . the acceptance of that constitution by puerto rico 's electorate , the u.s. congress , and the u.s. president occurred in 1952 . in addition , the rights , privileges and immunities attendant to united states citizens are " respected in puerto rico to the same extent as though puerto rico were a state of the union " through the express extension of the privileges and immunities clause of the u.s. constitution by the u.s. congress in 1948 .
late carboniferous and early permian insect orders include both extant groups , their stem groups , and a number of paleozoic groups , now extinct . during this era , some giant dragonfly-like forms reached wingspans of 55 to 70 cm ( 22 to 28 in ) , making them far larger than any living insect . this gigantism may have been due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels that allowed increased respiratory efficiency relative to today . the lack of flying vertebrates could have been another factor . most extinct orders of insects developed during the permian period that began around 270 million years ago . many of the early groups became extinct during the permian-triassic extinction event , the largest mass extinction in the history of the earth , around 252 million years ago .
the gregorian calendar was a reform of the julian calendar instituted in 1582 by pope gregory xiii , after whom the calendar was named , by papal bull inter gravissimas dated 24 february 1582 . the motivation for the adjustment was to bring the date for the celebration of easter to the time of year in which it was celebrated when it was introduced by the early church . although a recommendation of the first council of nicaea in 325 specified that all christians should celebrate easter on the same day , it took almost five centuries before virtually all christians achieved that objective by adopting the rules of the church of alexandria ( see easter for the issues which arose ) .
on 19 november 1968 , following progressive economic decline , the keïta regime was overthrown in a bloodless military coup led by moussa traoré , a day which is now commemorated as liberation day . the subsequent military-led regime , with traoré as president , attempted to reform the economy . his efforts were frustrated by political turmoil and a devastating drought between 1968 to 1974 , in which famine killed thousands of people . the traoré regime faced student unrest beginning in the late 1970s and three coup attempts . the traoré regime repressed all dissenters until the late 1980s .
in early times , the privilege of papal election was not reserved to the cardinals , and for centuries the person elected was customarily a roman priest and never a bishop from elsewhere . to preserve apostolic succession the rite of consecrating him a bishop had to be performed by someone who was already a bishop . the rule remains that , if the person elected pope is not yet a bishop , he is consecrated by the dean of the college of cardinals , the cardinal bishop of ostia .
during the period between 1582 , when the first countries adopted the gregorian calendar , and 1923 , when the last european country adopted it , it was often necessary to indicate the date of some event in both the julian calendar and in the gregorian calendar , for example , " 10/21 february 1750/51 " , where the dual year accounts for some countries already beginning their numbered year on 1 january while others were still using some other date . even before 1582 , the year sometimes had to be double dated because of the different beginnings of the year in various countries . woolley , writing in his biography of john dee ( 1527–1608/9 ) , notes that immediately after 1582 english letter writers " customarily " used " two dates " on their letters , one os and one ns .
saint barthélemy , a volcanic island fully encircled by shallow reefs , has an area of 25 square kilometres ( 9.7 sq mi ) and a population of 9,035 ( jan. 2011 estimate ) . its capital is gustavia [ citation needed ] , which also contains the main harbour to the island . it is the only caribbean island which was a swedish colony for any significant length of time ; guadeloupe was under swedish rule only briefly at the end of the napoleonic wars . symbolism from the swedish national arms , the three crowns , still appears in the island 's coat of arms . the language , cuisine , and culture , however , are distinctly french . the island is a popular tourist destination during the winter holiday season , especially for the rich and famous during the christmas and new year period .
alaska 's well-developed state-owned ferry system ( known as the alaska marine highway ) serves the cities of southeast , the gulf coast and the alaska peninsula . the ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers . the system also operates a ferry service from bellingham , washington and prince rupert , british columbia in canada through the inside passage to skagway . the inter-island ferry authority also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the prince of wales island region of southeast and works in concert with the alaska marine highway .
the term ashkenazi also refers to the nusach ashkenaz ( hebrew , " liturgical tradition " , or rite ) used by ashkenazi jews in their siddur ( prayer book ) . a nusach is defined by a liturgical tradition 's choice of prayers , order of prayers , text of prayers and melodies used in the singing of prayers . two other major forms of nusach among ashkenazic jews are nusach sefard ( not to be confused with the sephardic ritual ) , which is the general polish hasidic nusach , and nusach ari , as used by lubavitch hasidim .
in the united states , two of the wealthiest nonprofit organizations are the bill and melinda gates foundation , which has an endowment of us $ 38 billion , and the howard hughes medical institute originally funded by hughes aircraft prior to divestiture , which has an endowment of approximately $ 14.8 billion . outside the united states , another large npo is the british wellcome trust , which is a " charity " by british usage . see : list of wealthiest foundations . note that this assessment excludes universities , at least a few of which have assets in the tens of billions of dollars . for example ; list of u.s. colleges and universities by endowment .
the earliest evidence of human inhabitants of modern day chihuahua was discovered in the area of samalayuca and rancho colorado . clovis points have been found in northeastern chihuahua that have been dated from 12,000 bc to 7000 bc . it is thought that these inhabitants were hunter gatherers . inhabitants of the state later developed farming with the domestication of corn . an archeological site in northern chihuahua known as cerro juanaqueña revealed squash cultivation , irrigation techniques , and ceramic artifacts dating to around 2000 bc .
bowers confronted a similar problem in his edition of maggie . crane originally printed the novel privately in 1893 . to secure commercial publication in 1896 , crane agreed to remove profanity , but he also made stylistic revisions . bowers 's approach was to preserve the stylistic and literary changes of 1896 , but to revert to the 1893 readings where he believed that crane was fulfilling the publisher 's intention rather than his own . there were , however , intermediate cases that could reasonably have been attributed to either intention , and some of bowers 's choices came under fire – both as to his judgment , and as to the wisdom of conflating readings from the two different versions of maggie .
the investigation of the transmitted signals started immediately after the launch of compass -m1 on 14 april 2007 . soon after in june 2007 , engineers at cnes reported the spectrum and structure of the signals . a month later , researchers from stanford university reported the complete decoding of the “ i ” signals components . the knowledge of the codes allowed a group of engineers at septentrio to build the compass receiver and report tracking and multipath characteristics of the “ i ” signals on e2 and e5b .
political unification returned in the mid-16th century , due to the efforts of taungoo , a former vassal state of ava . taungoo 's young , ambitious king tabinshwehti defeated the more powerful hanthawaddy in the toungoo–hanthawaddy war ( 1534–41 ) . his successor bayinnaung went on to conquer a vast swath of mainland southeast asia including the shan states , lan na , manipur , mong mao , the ayutthaya kingdom , lan xang and southern arakan . however , the largest empire in the history of southeast asia unravelled soon after bayinnaung 's death in 1581 , completely collapsing by 1599 . ayutthaya seized tenasserim and lan na , and portuguese mercenaries established portuguese rule at thanlyin ( syriam ) .
brigham young university 's origin can be traced back to 1862 when a man named warren dusenberry started a provo school in a prominent adobe building called cluff hall , which was located in the northeast corner of 200 east and 200 north . on october 16 , 1875 , brigham young , then president of the lds church , personally purchased the lewis building after previously hinting that a school would be built in draper , utah in 1867 . hence , october 16 , 1875 is commonly held as byu 's founding date . said young about his vision : " i hope to see an academy established in provo ... at which the children of the latter-day saints can receive a good education unmixed with the pernicious atheistic influences that are found in so many of the higher schools of the country . "
summers in the state are generally hot and humid , with most of the state averaging a high of around 90 °f ( 32 °c ) during the summer months . winters tend to be mild to cool , increasing in coolness at higher elevations . generally , for areas outside the highest mountains , the average overnight lows are near freezing for most of the state . the highest recorded temperature is 113 °f ( 45 °c ) at perryville on august 9 , 1930 while the lowest recorded temperature is −32 °f ( −36 °c ) at mountain city on december 30 , 1917 .
this new approach liberated scientific speculation from the dogmatic restraints of aristotelian science , and paved the way for new approaches . particularly within the field of theories of motion great advances were made , when such scholars as jean buridan , nicole oresme and the oxford calculators challenged the work of aristotle . buridan developed the theory of impetus as the cause of the motion of projectiles , which was an important step towards the modern concept of inertia . the works of these scholars anticipated the heliocentric worldview of nicolaus copernicus .
with the help of charles stearn , an expert on vacuum pumps , in 1878 , swan developed a method of processing that avoided the early bulb blackening . this received a british patent in 1880 . [ dubious – discuss ] on 18 december 1878 , a lamp using a slender carbon rod was shown at a meeting of the newcastle chemical society , and swan gave a working demonstration at their meeting on 17 january 1879 . it was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the literary and philosophical society of newcastle upon tyne on 3 february 1879 . these lamps used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a slender filament . thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current , so they were not commercially practical , although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum , a carbon conductor , and platinum lead-in wires . besides requiring too much current for a central station electric system to be practical , they had a very short lifetime . swan turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament and the means of attaching its ends . he devised a method of treating cotton to produce 'parchmentised thread ' and obtained british patent 4933 in 1880 . from this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in england . his house was the first in the world to be lit by a lightbulb and also the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectric power . in 1878 the home of lord armstrong at cragside was also among the first houses to be lit by electricity . in the early 1880s he had started his company . in 1881 , the savoy theatre in the city of westminster , london was lit by swan incandescent lightbulbs , which was the first theatre , and the first public building in the world , to be lit entirely by electricity .
eisenhower began smoking cigarettes at west point , often two or three packs a day . eisenhower stated that he " gave [ himself ] an order " to stop cold turkey in march 1949 while at columbia . he was probably the first president to release information about his health and medical records while in office . on september 24 , 1955 , while vacationing in colorado , he had a serious heart attack that required six weeks ' hospitalization , during which time nixon , dulles , and sherman adams assumed administrative duties and provided communication with the president . he was treated by dr. paul dudley white , a cardiologist with a national reputation , who regularly informed the press of the president 's progress . instead of eliminating him as a candidate for a second term as president , his physician recommended a second term as essential to his recovery .
in the 1820s , boston 's population grew rapidly , and the city 's ethnic composition changed dramatically with the first wave of european immigrants . irish immigrants dominated the first wave of newcomers during this period , especially following the irish potato famine ; by 1850 , about 35,000 irish lived in boston . in the latter half of the 19th century , the city saw increasing numbers of irish , germans , lebanese , syrians , french canadians , and russian and polish jews settled in the city . by the end of the 19th century , boston 's core neighborhoods had become enclaves of ethnically distinct immigrants—italians inhabited the north end , irish dominated south boston and charlestown , and russian jews lived in the west end . irish and italian immigrants brought with them roman catholicism . currently , catholics make up boston 's largest religious community , and since the early 20th century , the irish have played a major role in boston politics—prominent figures include the kennedys , tip o'neill , and john f. fitzgerald .
the process of morphological derivation in catalan follows the same principles as the other romance languages , where agglutination is common . many times , several affixes are appended to a preexisting lexeme , and some sound alternations can occur , for example elèctric [ əˈlɛktrik ] ( " electrical " ) vs. electricitat [ ələktrisiˈtat ] . prefixes are usually appended to verbs , for as in preveure ( " foresee " ) .
it seems an oracular cult existed in delphi from the mycenaean ages . in historical times , the priests of delphi were called labryaden , " the double-axe men " , which indicates minoan origin . the double-axe , labrys , was the holy symbol of the cretan labyrinth . the homeric hymn adds that apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried cretan priests to delphi , where they evidently transferred their religious practices . apollo delphinios was a sea-god especially worshiped in crete and in the islands , and his name indicates his connection with delphi and the holy serpent delphyne ( " womb " ) . [ citation needed ] apollo 's sister artemis , who was the greek goddess of hunting , is identified with britomartis ( diktynna ) , the minoan " mistress of the animals " . in her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the " mister of the animals " , a male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute . his original name is unknown , but it seems that he was absorbed by the more popular apollo , who stood by the virgin " mistress of the animals " , becoming her brother .
thomas edison began serious research into developing a practical incandescent lamp in 1878 . edison filed his first patent application for " improvement in electric lights " on 14 october 1878 . after many experiments , first with carbon in the early 1880s and then with platinum and other metals , in the end edison returned to a carbon filament . the first successful test was on 22 october 1879 , and lasted 13.5 hours . edison continued to improve this design and by 4 november 1879 , filed for a us patent for an electric lamp using " a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected ... to platina contact wires . " although the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including using " cotton and linen thread , wood splints , papers coiled in various ways , " edison and his team later discovered that a carbonized bamboo filament could last more than 1200 hours . in 1880 , the oregon railroad and navigation company steamer , columbia , became the first application for edison 's incandescent electric lamps ( it was also the first ship to execute use of a dynamo ) .
hunting and gathering was presumably the subsistence strategy employed by human societies beginning some 1.8 million years ago , by homo erectus , and from its appearance some 0.2 million years ago by homo sapiens . it remained the only mode of subsistence until the end of the mesolithic period some 10,000 years ago , and after this was replaced only gradually with the spread of the neolithic revolution .
eduardo bonilla-silva , sociology professor at duke university , remarks , " i contend that racism is , more than anything else , a matter of group power ; it is about a dominant racial group ( whites ) striving to maintain its systemic advantages and minorities fighting to subvert the racial status quo . " the types of practices that take place under this new color-blind racism is subtle , institutionalized , and supposedly not racial . color-blind racism thrives on the idea that race is no longer an issue in the united states . there are contradictions between the alleged color-blindness of most whites and the persistence of a color-coded system of inequality .
in the u.s. , for example , copyright case law contains a substantial similarity requirement to determine whether the work was copied . likewise , courts may require computer software to pass an abstraction-filtration-comparison test ( afc test ) to determine if it is too abstract to qualify for protection , or too dissimilar to an original work to be considered infringing . software-related case law has also clarified that the amount of r & d , effort and expense put into a work 's creation does n't affect copyright protection .
after mary continued in the " blood of her purifying " another 33 days for a total of 40 days , she brought her burnt offering and sin offering to the temple in jerusalem , [ luke 2:22 ] so the priest could make atonement for her sins , being cleansed from her blood . [ leviticus 12:1-8 ] they also presented jesus – " as it is written in the law of the lord , every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord " ( luke 2:23other verses ) . after the prophecies of simeon and the prophetess anna in luke 2:25-38 concluded , joseph and mary took jesus and " returned into galilee , to their own city nazareth " . [ luke 2:39 ]
adult insects typically move about by walking , flying , or sometimes swimming ( see below , locomotion ) . as it allows for rapid yet stable movement , many insects adopt a tripedal gait in which they walk with their legs touching the ground in alternating triangles . insects are the only invertebrates to have evolved flight . many insects spend at least part of their lives under water , with larval adaptations that include gills , and some adult insects are aquatic and have adaptations for swimming . some species , such as water striders , are capable of walking on the surface of water . insects are mostly solitary , but some , such as certain bees , ants and termites , are social and live in large , well-organized colonies . some insects , such as earwigs , show maternal care , guarding their eggs and young . insects can communicate with each other in a variety of ways . male moths can sense the pheromones of female moths over great distances . other species communicate with sounds : crickets stridulate , or rub their wings together , to attract a mate and repel other males . lampyridae in the beetle order coleoptera communicate with light .
on march 30 , 2015 , it was announced that west is a co-owner , with various other music artists , in the music streaming service tidal . the service specialises in lossless audio and high definition music videos . jay z acquired the parent company of tidal , aspiro , in the first quarter of 2015 . including beyoncé and jay-z , sixteen artist stakeholders ( such as rihanna , beyoncé , madonna , chris martin , nicki minaj and more ) co-own tidal , with the majority owning a 3 % equity stake . the idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry , and to rival other streaming services such as spotify , which have been criticised for their low payout of royalties . " the challenge is to get everyone to respect music again , to recognize its value " , stated jay-z on the release of tidal .
within the diasporan armenian community , there is an unofficial classification of the different kinds of armenians . for example , armenians who originate from iran are referred to as parskahay ( պարսկահայ ) , while armenians from lebanon are usually referred to as lipananahay ( լիբանանահայ ) . armenians of the diaspora are the primary speakers of the western dialect of the armenian language . this dialect has considerable differences with eastern armenian , but speakers of either of the two variations can usually understand each other . eastern armenian in the diaspora is primarily spoken in iran and european countries such as ukraine , russia , and georgia ( where they form a majority in the samtskhe-javakheti province ) . in diverse communities ( such as in canada and the u.s. ) where many different kinds of armenians live together , there is a tendency for the different groups to cluster together .
in january 2012 , an armed conflict broke out in northern mali , which tuareg rebels took control of by april and declared the secession of a new state , azawad . the conflict was complicated by a military coup that took place in march and later fighting between tuareg and islamist rebels . in response to islamist territorial gains , the french military launched opération serval in january 2013 . a month later , malian and french forces recaptured most of the north . presidential elections were held on 28 july 2013 , with a second round run-off held on 11 august , and legislative elections were held on 24 november and 15 december 2013 .
registered dietitian nutritionists ( rds or rdns ) are health professionals qualified to provide safe , evidence-based dietary advice which includes a review of what is eaten , a thorough review of nutritional health , and a personalized nutritional treatment plan . they also provide preventive and therapeutic programs at work places , schools and similar institutions . certified clinical nutritionists or ccns , are trained health professionals who also offer dietary advice on the role of nutrition in chronic disease , including possible prevention or remediation by addressing nutritional deficiencies before resorting to drugs . government regulation especially in terms of licensing , is currently less universal for the ccn than that of rd or rdn . another advanced nutrition professional is a certified nutrition specialist or cns . these board certified nutritionists typically specialize in obesity and chronic disease . in order to become board certified , potential cns candidate must pass an examination , much like registered dieticians . this exam covers specific domains within the health sphere including ; clinical intervention and human health .
when the book was released , reviewers noted that it was divided into two parts , and opinion was mixed about lee 's ability to connect them . the first part of the novel concerns the children 's fascination with boo radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood . reviewers were generally charmed by scout and jem 's observations of their quirky neighbors . one writer was so impressed by lee 's detailed explanations of the people of maycomb that he categorized the book as southern romantic regionalism . this sentimentalism can be seen in lee 's representation of the southern caste system to explain almost every character 's behavior in the novel . scout 's aunt alexandra attributes maycomb 's inhabitants ' faults and advantages to genealogy ( families that have gambling streaks and drinking streaks ) , and the narrator sets the action and characters amid a finely detailed background of the finch family history and the history of maycomb . this regionalist theme is further reflected in mayella ewell 's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward tom robinson , and scout 's definition of " fine folks " being people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have . the south itself , with its traditions and taboos , seems to drive the plot more than the characters .
on november 10 , 2007 , at approximately 7:35 pm , paramedics responding to an emergency call transported west 's mother , donda west , to the nearby centinela freeman hospital in marina del rey , california . she was unresponsive in the emergency room , and after resuscitation attempts , doctors pronounced her dead at approximately 8:30 pm , at age 58 . the los angeles county coroner 's office said in january 2008 that west had died of heart disease while suffering " multiple post-operative factors " after plastic surgery . she had undergone liposuction and breast reduction . beverly hills plastic surgeon andre aboolian had refused to do the surgery because west had a health condition that placed her at risk for a heart attack . aboolian referred her to an internist to investigate her cardiac issue . she never met with the doctor recommended by aboolian and had the procedures performed by a third doctor , jan adams .
the university of plymouth enrolls 25,895 total students as of 2014/15 ( 22nd largest in the uk out of 165 ) . it also employs 3,000 staff with an annual income of around £160 million . it was founded in 1992 from polytechnic south west ( formerly plymouth polytechnic ) following the further and higher education act 1992 . it has courses in maritime business , marine engineering , marine biology and earth , ocean and environmental sciences , surf science , shipping and logistics . the university formed a joint venture with the fellow devonian university of exeter in 2000 , establishing the peninsula college of medicine and dentistry . the college is ranked 8th out of 30 universities in the uk in 2011 for medicine . its dental school was established in 2006 , which also provides free dental care in an attempt to improve access to dental care in the south west .
the vikings established danelaw over much of the eastern and northern part of england with its boundary roughly stretching from london to chester . it was an area of political and geographical control imposed by the viking incursions which was formally agreed to by the danish warlord , guthrum and west-saxon king , alfred the great in 886 ad . the anglo-saxon chronicle recorded that london was " refounded " by alfred the great in 886 . archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old roman walls . london then grew slowly until about 950 , after which activity increased dramatically .
evidence of wheeled vehicles appeared in the mid 4th millennium bc , near-simultaneously in mesopotamia , the northern caucasus ( maykop culture ) and central europe . the wheel initially took the form of the potter 's wheel . the new concept quickly led to wheeled vehicles and mill wheels . the sumerians ' cuneiform writing system is the oldest ( or second oldest after the egyptian hieroglyphs ) which has been deciphered ( the status of even older inscriptions such as the jiahu symbols and tartaria tablets is controversial ) . the sumerians were among the first astronomers , mapping the stars into sets of constellations , many of which survived in the zodiac and were also recognized by the ancient greeks . they were also aware of the five planets that are easily visible to the naked eye .
several dozen radioisotopes have been characterized . 65zn , which has a half-life of 243.66 days , is the most long-lived radioisotope , followed by 72zn with a half-life of 46.5 hours . zinc has 10 nuclear isomers . 69mzn has the longest half-life , 13.76 h. the superscript m indicates a metastable isotope . the nucleus of a metastable isotope is in an excited state and will return to the ground state by emitting a photon in the form of a gamma ray . 61zn has three excited states and 73zn has two . the isotopes 65zn , 71zn , 77zn and 78zn each have only one excited state .
king edward 's chair ( or st edward 's chair ) , the throne on which english and british sovereigns have been seated at the moment of coronation , is housed within the abbey and has been used at every coronation since 1308 . from 1301 to 1996 ( except for a short time in 1950 when it was temporarily stolen by scottish nationalists ) , the chair also housed the stone of scone upon which the kings of scots are crowned . although the stone is now kept in scotland , in edinburgh castle , at future coronations it is intended that the stone will be returned to st edward 's chair for use during the coronation ceremony .

a shipbuilding boom in the early part of the 20th century became massive during world war i , making seattle somewhat of a company town ; the subsequent retrenchment led to the seattle general strike of 1919 , the first general strike in the country . a 1912 city development plan by virgil bogue went largely unused . seattle was mildly prosperous in the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the great depression , experiencing some of the country 's harshest labor strife in that era . violence during the maritime strike of 1934 cost seattle much of its maritime traffic , which was rerouted to the port of los angeles .
under the 1995–2004 national hockey league collective bargaining agreement , teams were limited to nine preseason games . from 1975 to 1991 , nhl teams sometimes played exhibition games against teams from the soviet union in the super series , and in 1978 , played against world hockey association teams also in preseason training . like the nfl , the nhl sometimes schedules exhibition games for cities without their own nhl teams , often at a club 's minor league affiliate ( e.g . carolina hurricanes games at time warner cable arena in charlotte , home of their ahl affiliate ; los angeles kings games at citizens business bank arena in ontario , california , home of their echl affiliate ; montreal canadiens games at colisée pepsi in quebec city , which has no pro hockey but used to have an nhl team until 1995 ; washington capitals at 1st mariner arena in the baltimore hockey classic ; various western canada teams at credit union centre in saskatoon , a potential nhl expansion venue ) . since the 2000s , some preseason games have been played in europe against european teams , as part of the nhl challenge and nhl premiere series . in addition to the standard preseason , there also exist prospect tournaments such as the vancouver canucks ' youngstars tournament and the detroit red wings ' training camp , in which nhl teams ' younger prospects face off against each other under their parent club 's banner .
the genome size , and the number of genes it encodes varies widely between organisms . the smallest genomes occur in viruses ( which can have as few as 2 protein-coding genes ) , and viroids ( which act as a single non-coding rna gene ) . conversely , plants can have extremely large genomes , with rice containing > 46,000 protein-coding genes . the total number of protein-coding genes ( the earth 's proteome ) is estimated to be 5 million sequences .
in 1535 , the abbey 's annual income of £2400–2800 [ citation needed ] ( £1,310,000 to £1,530,000 as of 2016 ) , during the assessment attendant on the dissolution of the monasteries rendered it second in wealth only to glastonbury abbey .
jobs expanded so rapidly that 400,000 people were attracted to the city from 1941 to 1943 , including 50,000 blacks in the second wave of the great migration , and 350,000 whites , many of them from the south . some european immigrants and their descendants feared black competition for jobs and housing . the federal government prohibited discrimination in defense work but when in june 1943 , packard promoted three blacks to work next to whites on its assembly lines , 25,000 whites walked off the job . the detroit race riot of 1943 took place three weeks after the packard plant protest . over the course of three days , 34 people were killed , of whom 25 were african american , and approximately 600 were injured , 75 % black people .
on 10 october , hostilities began between german and french republican forces near orléans . at first , the germans were victorious but the french drew reinforcements and defeated the germans at the battle of coulmiers on 9 november . after the surrender of metz , more than 100,000 well-trained and experienced german troops joined the german 'southern army ' . the french were forced to abandon orléans on 4 december , and were finally defeated at the battle of le mans ( 10–12 january ) . a second french army which operated north of paris was turned back at the battle of amiens ( 27 november ) , the battle of bapaume ( 3 january 1871 ) and the battle of st. quentin ( 13 january ) .
in the kingdom of holland , the british launched the walcheren campaign to open up a second front in the war and to relieve the pressure on the austrians . the british army only landed at walcheren on 30 july , by which point the austrians had already been defeated . the walcheren campaign was characterized by little fighting but heavy casualties thanks to the popularly dubbed " walcheren fever . " over 4000 british troops were lost in a bungled campaign , and the rest withdrew in december 1809 . the main strategic result from the campaign became the delayed political settlement between the french and the austrians . emperor francis wanted to wait and see how the british performed in their theater before entering into negotiations with napoleon . once it became apparent that the british were going nowhere , the austrians agreed to peace talks .
coordination strategies differ when adjacent time zones shift clocks . the european union shifts all at once , at 01:00 utc or 02:00 cet or 03:00 eet ; for example , eastern european time is always one hour ahead of central european time . most of north america shifts at 02:00 local time , so its zones do not shift at the same time ; for example , mountain time is temporarily ( for one hour ) zero hours ahead of pacific time , instead of one hour ahead , in the autumn and two hours , instead of one , ahead of pacific time in the spring . in the past , australian districts went even further and did not always agree on start and end dates ; for example , in 2008 most dst-observing areas shifted clocks forward on october 5 but western australia shifted on october 26 . in some cases only part of a country shifts ; for example , in the us , hawaii and most of arizona do not observe dst .
islamic art frequently adopts the use of geometrical floral or vegetal designs in a repetition known as arabesque . such designs are highly nonrepresentational , as islam forbids representational depictions as found in pre-islamic pagan religions . despite this , there is a presence of depictional art in some muslim societies , notably the miniature style made famous in persia and under the ottoman empire which featured paintings of people and animals , and also depictions of quranic stories and islamic traditional narratives . another reason why islamic art is usually abstract is to symbolize the transcendence , indivisible and infinite nature of god , an objective achieved by arabesque . islamic calligraphy is an omnipresent decoration in islamic art , and is usually expressed in the form of quranic verses . two of the main scripts involved are the symbolic kufic and naskh scripts , which can be found adorning the walls and domes of mosques , the sides of minbars , and so on .
namibia ( i/nəˈmɪbiə/ , /næˈ-/ ) , officially the republic of namibia ( german : republik namibia ( help·info ) ; afrikaans : republiek van namibië ) is a country in southern africa whose western border is the atlantic ocean . it shares land borders with zambia and angola to the north , botswana to the east and south africa to the south and east . although it does not border zimbabwe , a part of less than 200 metres of the zambezi river ( essentially a small bulge in botswana to achieve a botswana/zambia micro-border ) separates it from that country . namibia gained independence from south africa on 21 march 1990 , following the namibian war of independence . its capital and largest city is windhoek , and it is a member state of the united nations ( un ) , the southern african development community ( sadc ) , the african union ( au ) , and the commonwealth of nations .
according to one of her biographers , giles st aubyn , victoria wrote an average of 2,500 words a day during her adult life . from july 1832 until just before her death , she kept a detailed journal , which eventually encompassed 122 volumes . after victoria 's death , her youngest daughter , princess beatrice , was appointed her literary executor . beatrice transcribed and edited the diaries covering victoria 's accession onwards , and burned the originals in the process . despite this destruction , much of the diaries still exist . in addition to beatrice 's edited copy , lord esher transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before beatrice destroyed them . part of victoria 's extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by a. c. benson , hector bolitho , george earle buckle , lord esher , roger fulford , and richard hough among others .
dollar coins have not been very popular in the united states . silver dollars were minted intermittently from 1794 through 1935 ; a copper-nickel dollar of the same large size , featuring president dwight d. eisenhower , was minted from 1971 through 1978 . gold dollars were also minted in the 19th century . the susan b. anthony dollar coin was introduced in 1979 ; these proved to be unpopular because they were often mistaken for quarters , due to their nearly equal size , their milled edge , and their similar color . minting of these dollars for circulation was suspended in 1980 ( collectors ' pieces were struck in 1981 ) , but , as with all past u.s. coins , they remain legal tender . as the number of anthony dollars held by the federal reserve and dispensed primarily to make change in postal and transit vending machines had been virtually exhausted , additional anthony dollars were struck in 1999 . in 2000 , a new $ 1 coin , featuring sacagawea , ( the sacagawea dollar ) was introduced , which corrected some of the problems of the anthony dollar by having a smooth edge and a gold color , without requiring changes to vending machines that accept the anthony dollar . however , this new coin has failed to achieve the popularity of the still-existing $ 1 bill and is rarely used in daily transactions . the failure to simultaneously withdraw the dollar bill and weak publicity efforts have been cited by coin proponents as primary reasons for the failure of the dollar coin to gain popular support .
as a result of the 19th century russo-persian wars , the russians took over the caucasus , and iran irrevocably lost control over its integral territories in the region ( comprising modern-day dagestan , georgia , armenia , and azerbaijan ) , which got confirmed per the treaties of gulistan and turkmenchay . the area to the north of the river aras , among which the contemporary republic of azerbaijan , eastern georgia , dagestan , and armenia , were iranian territory until they were occupied by russia in the course of the 19th century .
in the high renaissance , in fact , there was a hope that more direct knowledge of the wisdom of antiquity , including the writings of the church fathers , the earliest known greek texts of the christian gospels , and in some cases even the jewish kabbalah , would initiate a harmonious new era of universal agreement . with this end in view , renaissance church authorities afforded humanists what in retrospect appears a remarkable degree of freedom of thought . one humanist , the greek orthodox platonist gemistus pletho ( 1355–1452 ) , based in mystras , greece ( but in contact with humanists in florence , venice , and rome ) taught a christianised version of pagan polytheism .
the main mineral resource known on the continent is coal . it was first recorded near the beardmore glacier by frank wild on the nimrod expedition , and now low-grade coal is known across many parts of the transantarctic mountains . the prince charles mountains contain significant deposits of iron ore . the most valuable resources of antarctica lie offshore , namely the oil and natural gas fields found in the ross sea in 1973 . exploitation of all mineral resources is banned until 2048 by the protocol on environmental protection to the antarctic treaty .
federal law originates with the constitution , which gives congress the power to enact statutes for certain limited purposes like regulating interstate commerce . the united states code is the official compilation and codification of the general and permanent federal statutes . many statutes give executive branch agencies the power to create regulations , which are published in the federal register and codified into the code of federal regulations . regulations generally also carry the force of law under the chevron doctrine . many lawsuits turn on the meaning of a federal statute or regulation , and judicial interpretations of such meaning carry legal force under the principle of stare decisis .
an analysis of the evolution of mass media in the us and europe since world war ii noted mixed results from the growth of the internet : " the digital revolution has been good for freedom of expression [ and ] information [ but ] has had mixed effects on freedom of the press " : it has disrupted traditional sources of funding , and new forms of internet journalism have replaced only a tiny fraction of what 's been lost .
after they each performed , both were deemed equal until apollo decreed they play and sing at the same time . as apollo played the lyre , this was easy to do . marsyas could not do this , as he only knew how to use the flute and could not sing at the same time . apollo was declared the winner because of this . apollo flayed marsyas alive in a cave near celaenae in phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god . he then nailed marsyas ' shaggy skin to a nearby pine-tree . marsyas ' blood turned into the river marsyas .
genes with a most recent common ancestor , and thus a shared evolutionary ancestry , are known as homologs . these genes appear either from gene duplication within an organism 's genome , where they are known as paralogous genes , or are the result of divergence of the genes after a speciation event , where they are known as orthologous genes , :7.6 and often perform the same or similar functions in related organisms . it is often assumed that the functions of orthologous genes are more similar than those of paralogous genes , although the difference is minimal .
according to fig rules , only women compete in rhythmic gymnastics . this is a sport that combines elements of ballet , gymnastics , dance , and apparatus manipulation . the sport involves the performance of five separate routines with the use of five apparatus ; ball , ribbon , hoop , clubs , rope—on a floor area , with a much greater emphasis on the aesthetic rather than the acrobatic . there are also group routines consisting of 5 gymnasts and 5 apparatuses of their choice . rhythmic routines are scored out of a possible 30 points ; the score for artistry ( choreography and music ) is averaged with the score for difficulty of the moves and then added to the score for execution .
23-year-old candice glover won the season with kree harrison taking the runner-up spot . glover is the first female to win american idol since jordin sparks . glover released " i am beautiful " as a single while harrison released " all cried out " immediately after the show . glover sold poorly with her debut album , and this is also the first season that the runner-up was not signed by a music label .
according to the institute of russian language of the russian academy of sciences , an optional acute accent ( знак ударения ) may , and sometimes should , be used to mark stress . for example , it is used to distinguish between otherwise identical words , especially when context does not make it obvious : замо́к/за́мок ( lock/castle ) , сто́ящий/стоя́щий ( worthwhile/standing ) , чудно́/чу́дно ( this is odd/this is marvelous ) , молоде́ц/мо́лодец ( attaboy/fine young man ) , узна́ю/узнаю́ ( i shall learn it/i recognize it ) , отреза́ть/отре́зать ( to be cutting/to have cut ) ; to indicate the proper pronunciation of uncommon words , especially personal and family names ( афе́ра , гу́ру , гарси́я , оле́ша , фе́рми ) , and to show which is the stressed word in a sentence ( ты́ съел печенье ? /ты съе́л печенье ? /ты съел пече́нье ? – was it you who ate the cookie ? /did you eat the cookie ? /was it the cookie that you ate ? ) . stress marks are mandatory in lexical dictionaries and books for children or russian learners .
the premier league is broadcast in the united states through nbc sports . premier league viewership has increased rapidly , with nbc and nbcsn averaging a record 479,000 viewers in the 2014–15 season , up 118 % from 2012–13 when coverage still aired on fox soccer and espn/espn2 ( 220,000 viewers ) , and nbc sports has been widely praised for its coverage . nbc sports reached a six-year extension with the premier league in 2015 to broadcast the league through the 2021–22 season in a deal valued at $ 1 billion ( £640 million ) .
following his defeat in the civil war , gaddafi 's system of governance was dismantled and replaced under the interim government of the ntc , who legalised trade unions and freedom of the press . in july 2012 , elections were held to form a new general national congress ( gnc ) , who officially took over governance from the ntc in august . the gnc proceeded to elect mohammed magariaf as president of the chamber , and then voted mustafa a.g. abushagur as prime minister ; when abushagar failed to gain congressional approval , the gnc instead elected ali zeidan to the position . in january 2013 , the gnc officially renamed the jamahiriyah as the " state of libya " .
to unambiguously specify the date , dual dating or old style ( o.s . ) and new style ( n.s . ) are sometimes used with dates . dual dating uses two consecutive years because of differences in the starting date of the year , or includes both the julian and gregorian dates . old style and new style ( n.s . ) indicate either whether the start of the julian year has been adjusted to start on 1 january ( n.s . ) even though documents written at the time use a different start of year ( o.s . ) , or whether a date conforms to the julian calendar ( o.s . ) rather than the gregorian ( n.s . ) .
philadelphia is also a major hub for greyhound lines , which operates 24-hour service to points east of the mississippi river . most of greyhound 's services in philadelphia operate to/from the philadelphia greyhound terminal , located at 1001 filbert street in center city philadelphia . in 2006 , the philadelphia greyhound terminal was the second busiest greyhound terminal in the united states , after the port authority bus terminal in new york . besides greyhound , six other bus operators provide service to the center city greyhound terminal : bieber tourways , capitol trailways , martz trailways , peter pan bus lines , susquehanna trailways , and the bus division for new jersey transit . other services include megabus and bolt bus .
in the subtractive color system , used in painting and color printing , green is created by a combination of yellow and blue , or yellow and cyan ; in the rgb color model , used on television and computer screens , it is one of the additive primary colors , along with red and blue , which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors . on the hsv color wheel , also known as the rgb color wheel , the complement of green is magenta ; that is , a color corresponding to an equal mixture of red and blue light ( one of the purples ) . on a traditional color wheel , based on subtractive color , the complementary color to green is considered to be red .
there has also been an increase of yuppie , bohemian , and hipster types particularly around center city , the neighborhood of northern liberties , and in the neighborhoods around the city 's universities , such as near temple in north philadelphia and particularly near drexel and university of pennsylvania in west philadelphia . philadelphia is also home to a significant gay and lesbian population . philadelphia 's gayborhood , which is located near washington square , is home to a large concentration of gay and lesbian friendly businesses , restaurants , and bars .
after alexander the great 's ventures in the persian empire , hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout south-west asia ( seleucid empire , kingdom of pergamon ) , north-east africa ( ptolemaic kingdom ) and south asia ( greco-bactrian kingdom , indo-greek kingdom ) . this resulted in the export of greek culture and language to these new realms through greco-macedonian colonization , spanning as far as modern-day pakistan . equally , however , these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures , adopting local practices where beneficial , necessary , or convenient . hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the ancient greek world with that of the near east , middle east , and southwest asia , and a departure from earlier greek attitudes towards " barbarian " cultures . the hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of greek colonization ( as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries bc ) which established greek cities and kingdoms in asia and africa . those new cities were composed of greek colonists who came from different parts of the greek world , and not , as before , from a specific " mother city " . the main cultural centers expanded from mainland greece to pergamon , rhodes , and new greek colonies such as seleucia , antioch , alexandria and ai-khanoum . this mixture of greek-speakers gave birth to a common attic-based dialect , known as koine greek , which became the lingua franca through the hellenistic world .
after independence , dutch was dropped as an official language and replaced by malay . yet the indonesian language inherited many words from dutch : words for everyday life as well as scientific and technological terms . one scholar argues that 20 % of indonesian words can be traced back to dutch words , many of which are transliterated to reflect phonetic pronunciation e.g . kantoor ( dutch for " office " ) in indonesian is kantor , while bus ( " bus " ) becomes bis . in addition , many indonesian words are calques on dutch , for example , rumah sakit ( indonesian for " hospital " ) is calqued on the dutch ziekenhuis ( literally " house of the sick " ) , kebun binatang ( " zoo " ) on dierentuin ( literally " animal garden " ) , undang-undang dasar ( " constitution " ) from grondwet ( literally " ground law " ) . these account for some of the differences in vocabulary between indonesian and malay .
verdigris is made by placing a plate or blade of copper , brass or bronze , slightly warmed , into a vat of fermenting wine , leaving it there for several weeks , and then scraping off and drying the green powder that forms on the metal . the process of making verdigris was described in ancient times by pliny . it was used by the romans in the murals of pompeii , and in celtic medieval manuscripts as early as the 5th century ad . it produced a blue-green which no other pigment could imitate , but it had drawbacks ; it was unstable , it could not resist dampness , it did not mix well with other colors , it could ruin other colors with which it came into contact. , and it was toxic . leonardo da vinci , in his treatise on painting , warned artists not to use it . it was widely used in miniature paintings in europe and persia in the 16th and 17th centuries . its use largely ended in the late 19th century , when it was replaced by the safer and more stable chrome green . viridian , also called chrome green , is a pigment made with chromium oxide dihydrate , was patented in 1859 . it became popular with painters , since , unlike other synthetic greens , it was stable and not toxic . vincent van gogh used it , along with prussian blue , to create a dark blue sky with a greenish tint in his painting cafe terrace at night .
the war entered a new phase with the unprecedented defeat of the japanese at battle of suixian-zaoyang and 1st battle of changsha . after these victories , chinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive in early 1940 ; however , due to its low military-industrial capacity , it was repulsed by japanese army in late march 1940 . in august of 1940 , chinese communists launched an offensive in central china ; in retaliation , japan instituted the " three alls policy " ( " kill all , burn all , loot all " ) in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists . by 1941 the conflict had become a stalemate . although japan had occupied much of northern , central , and coastal china , the nationalist government had retreated to the interior with a provisional capital set up at chungking while the chinese communists remained in control of base areas in shaanxi . in addition , japanese control of northern and central china was somewhat tenuous , in that japan was usually able to control railroads and the major cities ( " points and lines " ) , but did not have a major military or administrative presence in the vast chinese countryside . the japanese found its aggression against the retreating and regrouping chinese army was stalled by the mountainous terrain in southwestern china while the communists organised widespread guerrilla and saboteur activities in northern and eastern china behind the japanese front line .
byu alumni in academia include former dean of the harvard business school kim b. clark , two time world 's most influential business thinker clayton m. christensen , michael k. young '73 , current president of the university of washington , matthew s. holland , current president of utah valley university , stan l. albrecht , current president of utah state university , teppo felin , professor at the university of oxford , and stephen d. nadauld , previous president of dixie state university . the university also graduated nobel prize winner paul d. boyer , as well as philo farnsworth ( inventor of the electronic television ) and harvey fletcher ( inventor of the hearing aid ) . four of byu 's thirteen presidents were alumni of the university . additionally , alumni of byu who have served as business leaders include citigroup cfo gary crittenden '76 , former dell ceo kevin rollins '84 , deseret book ceo sheri l. dew , and matthew k. mccauley , ceo of children 's clothing company gymboree .
during the american civil war , american cotton exports slumped due to a union blockade on southern ports , and also because of a strategic decision by the confederate government to cut exports , hoping to force britain to recognize the confederacy or enter the war . this prompted the main purchasers of cotton , britain and france , to turn to egyptian cotton . british and french traders invested heavily in cotton plantations . the egyptian government of viceroy isma'il took out substantial loans from european bankers and stock exchanges . after the american civil war ended in 1865 , british and french traders abandoned egyptian cotton and returned to cheap american exports , [ citation needed ] sending egypt into a deficit spiral that led to the country declaring bankruptcy in 1876 , a key factor behind egypt 's occupation by the british empire in 1882 .
john locke , one of the most influential enlightenment thinkers , based his governance philosophy in social contract theory , a subject that permeated enlightenment political thought . the english philosopher thomas hobbes ushered in this new debate with his work leviathan in 1651 . hobbes also developed some of the fundamentals of european liberal thought : the right of the individual ; the natural equality of all men ; the artificial character of the political order ( which led to the later distinction between civil society and the state ) ; the view that all legitimate political power must be " representative " and based on the consent of the people ; and a liberal interpretation of law which leaves people free to do whatever the law does not explicitly forbid .
the community was established by several shiploads of settlers from bermuda ( which lies due east of south carolina , although at 1,030 km or 640 mi , it is closest to cape hatteras , north carolina ) , under the leadership of governor william sayle , on the west bank of the ashley river , a few miles northwest of the present-day city center . it was soon predicted by the earl of shaftesbury , one of the lords proprietors , to become a " great port towne " , a destiny the city quickly fulfilled . in 1680 , the settlement was moved east of the ashley river to the peninsula between the ashley and cooper rivers . not only was this location more defensible , but it also offered access to a fine natural harbor .
in the southern netherlands ( now belgium and luxembourg ) developments were different . under spanish , then austrian , and then french rule standardisation of dutch language came to a standstill . the state , law , and increasingly education used french , yet more than half the belgian population were speaking a dutch dialect . in the course of the nineteenth century the flemish movement stood up for the rights of dutch , mostly called flemish . but in competing with the french language the variation in dialects was a serious disadvantage . since standardisation is a lengthy process , dutch-speaking belgium associated itself with the standard language that had already developed in the netherlands over the centuries . therefore , the situation in belgium is essentially no different from that in the netherlands , although there are recognisable differences in pronunciation , comparable to the pronunciation differences between standard british and standard american english . in 1980 the netherlands and belgium concluded the language union treaty . this treaty lays down the principle that the two countries must gear their language policy to each other , among other things , for a common system of spelling .
after the american revolutionary war , the number and proportion of free people of color increased markedly in the north and the south as slaves were freed . most northern states abolished slavery , sometimes , like new york , in programs of gradual emancipation that took more than two decades to be completed . the last slaves in new york were not freed until 1827 . in connection with the second great awakening , quaker and methodist preachers in the south urged slaveholders to free their slaves . revolutionary ideals led many men to free their slaves , some by deed and others by will , so that from 1782 to 1810 , the percentage of free people of color rose from less than one percent to nearly 10 percent of blacks in the south .
the economic reforms of president carlos salinas de gortari had a tremendous effect on the city , as a number of businesses , including banks and airlines , were privatized . he also signed the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) . this led to decentralization and a shift in mexico city 's economic base , from manufacturing to services , as most factories moved away to either the state of mexico , or more commonly to the northern border . by contrast , corporate office buildings set their base in the city .
the earliest writers on sexual orientation usually understood it to be intrinsically linked to the subject 's own sex . for example , it was thought that a typical female-bodied person who is attracted to female-bodied persons would have masculine attributes , and vice versa . this understanding was shared by most of the significant theorists of sexual orientation from the mid nineteenth to early twentieth century , such as karl heinrich ulrichs , richard von krafft-ebing , magnus hirschfeld , havelock ellis , carl jung , and sigmund freud , as well as many gender-variant homosexual people themselves . however , this understanding of homosexuality as sexual inversion was disputed at the time , and , through the second half of the twentieth century , gender identity came to be increasingly seen as a phenomenon distinct from sexual orientation . transgender and cisgender people may be attracted to men , women , or both , although the prevalence of different sexual orientations is quite different in these two populations . an individual homosexual , heterosexual or bisexual person may be masculine , feminine , or androgynous , and in addition , many members and supporters of lesbian and gay communities now see the " gender-conforming heterosexual " and the " gender-nonconforming homosexual " as negative stereotypes . nevertheless , studies by j. michael bailey and kenneth zucker found a majority of the gay men and lesbians sampled reporting various degrees of gender-nonconformity during their childhood years .
because neither korea had a significant navy , the korean war featured few naval battles . a skirmish between north korea and the un command occurred on 2 july 1950 ; the u.s. navy cruiser uss juneau , the royal navy cruiser hms jamaica , and the frigate hms black swan fought four north korean torpedo boats and two mortar gunboats , and sank them . uss juneau later sank several ammunition ships that had been present . the last sea battle of the korean war occurred at inchon , days before the battle of incheon ; the rok ship pc-703 sank a north korean mine layer in the battle of haeju island , near inchon . three other supply ships were sunk by pc-703 two days later in the yellow sea . thereafter , vessels from the un nations held undisputed control of the sea about korea . the gun ships were used in shore bombardment , while the aircraft carriers provided air support to the ground forces .
on 20 february 2001 , the bureau announced that a special agent , robert hanssen ( born 1944 ) had been arrested for spying for the soviet union and then russia from 1979 to 2001 . he is serving 15 consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole at adx florence , a federal supermax prison near florence , colorado . hanssen was arrested on february 18 , 2001 at foxstone park near his home in vienna , virginia , and was charged with selling us secrets to the ussr and subsequently russia for more than us $ 1.4 million in cash and diamonds over a 22-year period . on july 6 , 2001 , he pleaded guilty to 15 counts of espionage in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia . his spying activities have been described by the us department of justice 's commission for the review of fbi security programs as " possibly the worst intelligence disaster in u.s. history " .
a narthex ( a portico or entrance hall ) for the west front was designed by sir edwin lutyens in the mid-20th century but was not built . images of the abbey prior to the construction of the towers are scarce , though the abbey 's official website states that the building was without towers following yevele 's renovation , with just the lower segments beneath the roof level of the nave completed .
following al-farabi 's lead , avicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being , in which he distinguished between essence ( mahiat ) and existence ( wujud ) . he argued that the fact of existence can not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things , and that form and matter by themselves can not interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things . existence must , therefore , be due to an agent-cause that necessitates , imparts , gives , or adds existence to an essence . to do so , the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect .
this effectively means that populations of organisms must have reached a certain measurable level of difference to be recognised as subspecies . dean amadon proposed in 1949 that subspecies would be defined according to the seventy-five percent rule which means that 75 % of a population must lie outside 99 % of the range of other populations for a given defining morphological character or a set of characters . the seventy-five percent rule still has defenders but other scholars argue that it should be replaced with ninety or ninety-five percent rule .
this does not mean that samurai women were always powerless . powerful women both wisely and unwisely wielded power at various occasions . after ashikaga yoshimasa , 8th shogun of the muromachi shogunate , lost interest in politics , his wife hino tomiko largely ruled in his place . nene , wife of toyotomi hideyoshi , was known to overrule her husband 's decisions at times and yodo-dono , his concubine , became the de facto master of osaka castle and the toyotomi clan after hideyoshi 's death . tachibana ginchiyo was chosen to lead the tachibana clan after her father 's death . chiyo , wife of yamauchi kazutoyo , has long been considered the ideal samurai wife . according to legend , she made her kimono out of a quilted patchwork of bits of old cloth and saved pennies to buy her husband a magnificent horse , on which he rode to many victories . the fact that chiyo ( though she is better known as " wife of yamauchi kazutoyo " ) is held in such high esteem for her economic sense is illuminating in the light of the fact that she never produced an heir and the yamauchi clan was succeeded by kazutoyo 's younger brother . the source of power for women may have been that samurai left their finances to their wives .
canadian football is also played at the high school , junior , collegiate , and semi-professional levels : the canadian junior football league , formed may 8 , 1974 , and quebec junior football league are leagues for players aged 18–22 , many post-secondary institutions compete in canadian interuniversity sport for the vanier cup , and senior leagues such as the alberta football league have grown in popularity in recent years . great achievements in canadian football are enshrined in the canadian football hall of fame .
for the first several decades of disc record manufacturing , sound was recorded directly on to the " master disc " at the recording studio . from about 1950 on ( earlier for some large record companies , later for some small ones ) it became usual to have the performance first recorded on audio tape , which could then be processed and/or edited , and then dubbed on to the master disc . a record cutter would engrave the grooves into the master disc . early versions of these master discs were soft wax , and later a harder lacquer was used . the mastering process was originally something of an art as the operator had to manually allow for the changes in sound which affected how wide the space for the groove needed to be on each rotation .
wendy leigh , who wrote an unofficial biography on schwarzenegger , claims he plotted his political rise from an early age using the movie business and bodybuilding as building blocks to escape a depressing home . leigh portrays schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying , " i wanted to be part of the small percentage of people who were leaders , not the large mass of followers . i think it is because i saw leaders use 100 % of their potential – i was always fascinated by people in control of other people . " schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter politics , but he says , " i married into a political family . you get together with them and you hear about policy , about reaching out to help people . i was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and eunice and sargent shriver became my heroes . " eunice kennedy shriver was sister of john f. kennedy , and mother-in-law to schwarzenegger ; sargent shriver is husband to eunice and father-in-law to schwarzenegger . he can not run for president as he is not a natural born citizen of the united states . in the simpsons movie ( 2007 ) , he is portrayed as the president , and in the sylvester stallone movie , demolition man ( 1993 , ten years before his first run for political office ) , it is revealed that a constitutional amendment passed which allowed schwarzenegger to become president .
the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) is the domestic intelligence and security service of the united states , which simultaneously serves as the nation 's prime federal law enforcement organization . operating under the jurisdiction of the u.s. department of justice , fbi is concurrently a member of the u.s. intelligence community and reports to both the attorney general and the director of national intelligence . a leading u.s. counterterrorism , counterintelligence , and criminal investigative organization , fbi has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes .
in 1988 imperial merged with st mary 's hospital medical school , becoming the imperial college of science , technology and medicine . in 1995 imperial launched its own academic publishing house , imperial college press , in partnership with world scientific . imperial merged with the national heart and lung institute in 1995 and the charing cross and westminster medical school , royal postgraduate medical school ( rpms ) and the institute of obstetrics and gynaecology in 1997 . in the same year the imperial college school of medicine was formally established and all of the property of charing cross and westminster medical school , the national heart and lung institute and the royal postgraduate medical school were transferred to imperial as the result of the imperial college act 1997 . in 1998 the sir alexander fleming building was opened by queen elizabeth ii to provide a headquarters for the college 's medical and biomedical research .
in 1953 , korolev was given the go-ahead to develop the r-7 semyorka rocket , which represented a major advance from the german design . although some of its components ( notably boosters ) still resembled the german g-4 , the new rocket incorporated staged design , a completely new control system , and a new fuel . it was successfully tested on august 21 , 1957 and became the world 's first fully operational icbm the following month . it would later be used to launch the first satellite into space , and derivatives would launch all piloted soviet spacecraft .
in ancient somalia , pyramidical structures known in somali as taalo were a popular burial style , with hundreds of these dry stone monuments scattered around the country today . houses were built of dressed stone similar to the ones in ancient egypt . there are also examples of courtyards and large stone walls enclosing settlements , such as the wargaade wall .
spielberg 's next film , schindler 's list , was based on the true story of oskar schindler , a man who risked his life to save 1,100 jews from the holocaust . schindler 's list earned spielberg his first academy award for best director ( it also won best picture ) . with the film a huge success at the box office , spielberg used the profits to set up the shoah foundation , a non-profit organization that archives filmed testimony of holocaust survivors . in 1997 , the american film institute listed it among the 10 greatest american films ever made ( # 9 ) which moved up to ( # 8 ) when the list was remade in 2007 .
by 3400 bce , the sahara was as dry as it is today , due to reduced precipitation and higher temperatures resulting from a shift in the earth 's orbit . as a result of this aridification , it became a largely impenetrable barrier to humans , with the remaining settlements mainly being concentrated around the numerous oases that dot the landscape . little trade or commerce is known to have passed through the interior in subsequent periods , the only major exception being the nile valley . the nile , however , was impassable at several cataracts , making trade and contact by boat difficult .
other armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned french-armenian singer and composer charles aznavour , pianist sahan arzruni , prominent opera sopranos such as hasmik papian and more recently isabel bayrakdarian and anna kasyan . certain armenians settled to sing non-armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band system of a down ( which nonetheless often incorporates traditional armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs ) or pop star cher . in the armenian diaspora , armenian revolutionary songs are popular with the youth . these songs encourage armenian patriotism and are generally about armenian history and national heroes .
anglicanism comprises the church of england and churches which are historically tied to it or hold similar beliefs , worship practices and church structures . the word anglican originates in ecclesia anglicana , a medieval latin phrase dating to at least 1246 that means the english church . there is no single " anglican church " with universal juridical authority , since each national or regional church has full autonomy . as the name suggests , the communion is an association of churches in full communion with the archbishop of canterbury . the great majority of anglicans are members of churches which are part of the international anglican communion , which has 80 million adherents .
critics noted in 2013 that tom wheeler , the head of the fcc , which has to approve the deal , is the former head of both the largest cable lobbying organization , the national cable & telecommunications association , and as largest wireless lobby , ctia – the wireless association . according to politico , comcast " donated to almost every member of congress who has a hand in regulating it .

the international repertoire of music for mandolin is almost unlimited , and musicians use it to play various types of music . this is especially true of violin music , since the mandolin has the same tuning of the violin . following its invention and early development in italy the mandolin spread throughout the european continent . the instrument was primarily used in a classical tradition with mandolin orchestras , so called estudiantinas or in germany zupforchestern appearing in many cities . following this continental popularity of the mandolin family local traditions appeared outside of europe in the americas and in japan . travelling mandolin virtuosi like giuseppe pettine , raffaele calace and silvio ranieri contributed to the mandolin becoming a " fad " instrument in the early 20th century . this " mandolin craze " was fading by the 1930s , but just as this practice was falling into disuse , the mandolin found a new niche in american country , old-time music , bluegrass and folk music . more recently , the baroque and classical mandolin repertory and styles have benefited from the raised awareness of and interest in early music , with media attention to classical players such as israeli avi avital , italian carlo aonzo and american joseph brent .

although theoretically a collegial body operating through consensus building , gaddafi dominated the rcc , although some of the others attempted to constrain what they saw as his excesses . gaddafi remained the government 's public face , with the identities of the other rcc members only being publicly revealed on 10 january 1970 . all young men from ( typically rural ) working and middle-class backgrounds , none had university degrees ; in this way they were distinct from the wealthy , highly educated conservatives who previously governed the country .
according to the united states census bureau , the city has a total area of 656.3 square miles ( 1,700 km2 ) ; this comprises 634.0 square miles ( 1,642 km2 ) of land and 22.3 square miles ( 58 km2 ) of water . the piney woods is north of houston . most of houston is located on the gulf coastal plain , and its vegetation is classified as temperate grassland and forest . much of the city was built on forested land , marshes , swamp , or prairie which resembles the deep south , and are all still visible in surrounding areas . flatness of the local terrain , when combined with urban sprawl , has made flooding a recurring problem for the city . downtown stands about 50 feet ( 15 m ) above sea level , and the highest point in far northwest houston is about 125 feet ( 38 m ) in elevation . the city once relied on groundwater for its needs , but land subsidence forced the city to turn to ground-level water sources such as lake houston , lake conroe and lake livingston . the city owns surface water rights for 1.20 billion gallons of water a day in addition to 150 million gallons a day worth of groundwater .
a political party is typically led by a party leader ( the most powerful member and spokesperson representing the party ) , a party secretary ( who maintains the daily work and records of party meetings ) , party treasurer ( who is responsible for membership dues ) and party chair ( who forms strategies for recruiting and retaining party members , and also chairs party meetings ) . most of the above positions are also members of the party executive , the leading organization which sets policy for the entire party at the national level . the structure is far more decentralized in the united states because of the separation of powers , federalism and the multiplicity of economic interests and religious sects . even state parties are decentralized as county and other local committees are largely independent of state central committees . the national party leader in the u.s. will be the president , if the party holds that office , or a prominent member of congress in opposition ( although a big-state governor may aspire to that role ) . officially , each party has a chairman for its national committee who is a prominent spokesman , organizer and fund-raiser , but without the status of prominent elected office holders .
charles " wag " bennett , one of the judges at the 1966 competition , was impressed with schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him . as schwarzenegger had little money , bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in forest gate , london , england . yorton 's leg definition had been judged superior , and schwarzenegger , under a training program devised by bennett , concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs . staying in the east end of london helped schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the english language . also in 1966 , schwarzenegger had the opportunity to meet childhood idol reg park , who became his friend and mentor . the training paid off and , in 1967 , schwarzenegger won the title for the first time , becoming the youngest ever mr. universe at the age of 20 . he would go on to win the title a further three times . schwarzenegger then flew back to munich , training for four to six hours daily , attending business school and working in a health club ( rolf putziger 's gym where he worked and trained from 1966–1968 ) , returning in 1968 to london to win his next mr. universe title . he frequently told roger c. field , his english coach and friend in munich at that time , " i 'm going to become the greatest actor !

a group is called finite if it has a finite number of elements . the number of elements is called the order of the group . an important class is the symmetric groups sn , the groups of permutations of n letters . for example , the symmetric group on 3 letters s3 is the group consisting of all possible orderings of the three letters abc , i.e . contains the elements abc , acb , ... , up to cba , in total 6 ( or 3 factorial ) elements . this class is fundamental insofar as any finite group can be expressed as a subgroup of a symmetric group sn for a suitable integer n ( cayley 's theorem ) . parallel to the group of symmetries of the square above , s3 can also be interpreted as the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle .
there is ongoing debate about whether central banks should target zero inflation ( which would mean a constant value for the u.s. dollar over time ) or low , stable inflation ( which would mean a continuously but slowly declining value of the dollar over time , as is the case now ) . although some economists are in favor of a zero inflation policy and therefore a constant value for the u.s. dollar , others contend that such a policy limits the ability of the central bank to control interest rates and stimulate the economy when needed .
philadelphia 's two major daily newspapers are the philadelphia inquirer , which is the eighteenth largest newspaper and third-oldest surviving daily newspaper in the country , and the philadelphia daily news . both newspapers were purchased from the mcclatchy company ( after buying out knight ridder ) in 2006 by philadelphia media holdings and operated by the group until the organization declared bankruptcy in 2010 . after two years of financial struggle , the two newspapers were sold to interstate general media in 2012 . the two newspapers have a combined circulation of about 500,000 readers .
tuvalu experiences the effects of el niño and la niña caused by changes in ocean temperatures in the equatorial and central pacific . el niño effects increase the chances of tropical storms and cyclones , while la niña effects increase the chances of drought . typically the islands of tuvalu receive between 200 to 400 mm ( 8 to 16 in ) of rainfall per month . however , in 2011 a weak la niña effect caused a drought by cooling the surface of the sea around tuvalu . a state of emergency was declared on 28 september 2011 ; with rationing of fresh-water on the islands of funafuti and nukulaelae . households on funafuti and nukulaelae were restricted to two buckets of fresh water per day ( 40 litres ) .

tito 's estrangement from the ussr enabled yugoslavia to obtain us aid via the economic cooperation administration ( eca ) , the same us aid institution which administered the marshall plan . still , he did not agree to align with the west , which was a common consequence of accepting american aid at the time . after stalin 's death in 1953 , relations with the ussr were relaxed and he began to receive aid as well from the comecon . in this way , tito played east-west antagonism to his advantage . instead of choosing sides , he was instrumental in kick-starting the non-aligned movement , which would function as a 'third way ' for countries interested in staying outside of the east-west divide .
in the kingdom of holland , the british launched the walcheren campaign to open up a second front in the war and to relieve the pressure on the austrians . the british army only landed at walcheren on 30 july , by which point the austrians had already been defeated . the walcheren campaign was characterized by little fighting but heavy casualties thanks to the popularly dubbed " walcheren fever . " over 4000 british troops were lost in a bungled campaign , and the rest withdrew in december 1809 . the main strategic result from the campaign became the delayed political settlement between the french and the austrians . emperor francis wanted to wait and see how the british performed in their theater before entering into negotiations with napoleon . once it became apparent that the british were going nowhere , the austrians agreed to peace talks .

by 1763 , the war in central europe was essentially a stalemate . frederick had retaken most of silesia and saxony but not the latter 's capital , dresden . his financial situation was not dire , but his kingdom was devastated and his army severely weakened . his manpower had dramatically decreased , and he had lost so many effective officers and generals that a new offensive was perhaps impossible . british subsidies had been stopped by the new prime minister lord bute , and the russian emperor had been overthrown by his wife , catherine , who ended russia 's alliance with prussia and withdrew from the war . austria , however , like most participants , was facing a severe financial crisis and had to decrease the size of its army , something which greatly affected its offensive power . indeed , after having effectively sustained a long war , its administration was in disarray . by that time , it still held dresden , the southeastern parts of saxony , the county of glatz , and southern silesia , but the prospect of victory was dim without russian support . in 1763 a peace settlement was reached at the treaty of hubertusburg , ending the war in central europe .

yale and new haven are working to build a medical and biotechnology research hub in the city and greater new haven region , and are succeeding to some extent . [ citation needed ] the city , state and yale together run science park , a large site three blocks northwest of yale 's science hill campus . this multi-block site , approximately bordered by mansfield street , division street , and shelton avenue , is the former home of winchester 's and olin corporation 's 45 large-scale factory buildings . currently , sections of the site are large-scale parking lots or abandoned structures , but there is also a large remodeled and functioning area of buildings ( leased primarily by a private developer ) with numerous yale employees , financial service and biotech companies .
yale 's museum collections are also of international stature . the yale university art gallery , the country 's first university-affiliated art museum , contains more than 180,000 works , including old masters and important collections of modern art , in the swartout and kahn buildings . the latter , louis kahn 's first large-scale american work ( 1953 ) , was renovated and reopened in december 2006 . the yale center for british art , the largest collection of british art outside of the uk , grew from a gift of paul mellon and is housed in another kahn-designed building .
seattle was also the home base of impresario alexander pantages who , starting in 1902 , opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting vaudeville acts and silent movies . his activities soon expanded , and the thrifty greek went on and became one of america 's greatest theater and movie tycoons . between pantages and his rival john considine , seattle was for a while the western united states ' vaudeville mecca . b. marcus priteca , the scottish-born and seattle-based architect , built several theaters for pantages , including some in seattle . the theaters he built for pantages in seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses , but many other theaters survive in other cities of the u.s. , often retaining the pantages name ; seattle 's surviving paramount theatre , on which he collaborated , was not a pantages theater .
british post-punk entered the 1980s with support from members of the critical community—american critic greil marcus characterised " britain 's postpunk pop avant-garde " in a 1980 rolling stone article as " sparked by a tension , humour and sense of paradox plainly unique in present day pop music " —as well as media figures such as bbc dj john peel , while several groups , such as pil and joy division , achieved some success in the popular charts . the network of supportive record labels that included industrial , fast , e.g. , mute , axis/4ad and glass continued to facilitate a large output of music , by artists such as the raincoats , essential logic , killing joke , the teardrop explodes , and the psychedelic furs .

the longmen shan fault system is situated in the eastern border of the tibetan plateau and contains several faults . this earthquake ruptured at least two imbricate structures in longmen shan fault system , i.e . the beichuan fault and the guanxian–anxian fault . in the epicentral area , the average slip in beichuan fault was about 3.5 metres ( 11 ft ) vertical , 3.5 metres ( 11 ft ) horizontal-parallel to the fault , and 4.8 metres ( 16 ft ) horizontal-perpendicular to the fault . in the area about 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) northeast of the epicenter , the surface slip on beichuan fault was almost purely dextral strike-slip up to about 3 metres ( 9.8 ft ) , while the average slip in guanxian–anxian fault was about 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) vertical and 2.3 metres ( 7 ft 7 in ) horizontal .
although there is some evidence of earlier inhabitation in the region of utrecht , dating back to the stone age ( app . 2200 bce ) and settling in the bronze age ( app . 1800–800 bce ) , the founding date of the city is usually related to the construction of a roman fortification ( castellum ) , probably built in around 50 ce . a series of such fortresses was built after the roman emperor claudius decided the empire should not expand north . to consolidate the border the limes germanicus defense line was constructed along the main branch of the river rhine , which at that time flowed through a more northern bed compared to today ( what is now the kromme rijn ) . these fortresses were designed to house a cohort of about 500 roman soldiers . near the fort settlements would grow housing artisans , traders and soldiers ' wives and children .
much of the medieval period was a time of power struggles between competing dynasties such as the house of savoy , the visconti in northern italy and the house of habsburg in austria and slovenia . in 1291 to protect themselves from incursions by the habsburgs , four cantons in the middle of switzerland drew up a charter that is considered to be a declaration of independence from neighboring kingdoms . after a series of battles fought in the 13th , 14th and 15th centuries , more cantons joined the confederacy and by the 16th century switzerland was well-established as a separate state .
georgian succeeded the english baroque of sir christopher wren , sir john vanbrugh , thomas archer , william talman , and nicholas hawksmoor ; this in fact continued into at least the 1720s , overlapping with a more restrained georgian style . the architect james gibbs was a transitional figure , his earlier buildings are baroque , reflecting the time he spent in rome in the early 18th century , but he adjusted his style after 1720 . major architects to promote the change in direction from baroque were colen campbell , author of the influential book vitruvius britannicus ( 1715-1725 ) ; richard boyle , 3rd earl of burlington and his protégé william kent ; isaac ware ; henry flitcroft and the venetian giacomo leoni , who spent most of his career in england . other prominent architects of the early georgian period include james paine , robert taylor , and john wood , the elder . the european grand tour became very common for wealthy patrons in the period , and italian influence remained dominant , though at the start of the period hanover square , westminster ( 1713 on ) , developed and occupied by whig supporters of the new dynasty , seems to have deliberately adopted german stylisic elements in their honour , especially vertical bands connecting the windows .
according to chen , the ming officer of hezhou ( modern day linxia ) informed the hongwu emperor that the general situation in dbus and gtsang " was under control , " and so he suggested to the emperor that he offer the second phagmodru ruler , jamyang shakya gyaltsen , an official title . according to the records of the founding emperor , the hongwu emperor issued an edict granting the title " initiation state master " to sagya gyaincain , while the latter sent envoys to the ming court to hand over his jade seal of authority along with tribute of colored silk and satin , statues of the buddha , buddhist scriptures , and sarira .
new sequencing technologies , such as massive parallel sequencing have also opened up the prospect of personal genome sequencing as a diagnostic tool , as pioneered by manteia predictive medicine . a major step toward that goal was the completion in 2007 of the full genome of james d. watson , one of the co-discoverers of the structure of dna .
there are several technologies aimed to provide better experience to passengers suffering from claustrophobia , anthropophobia or social anxiety . israeli startup digigage uses motion sensors to scroll the pre-rendered images , building and floor-specific content on a screen embedded into the wall as the cab moves up and down . british company lifteye provides a virtual window technology to turn common elevator into panoramic . it creates 3d video panorama using live feed from cameras placed vertically along the facade and synchronizes it with cab movement . the video is projected on a wall-sized screens making it look like the walls are made of glass .
in 1886 , woolwich munitions workers founded the club as dial square . in 1913 , the club crossed the city to arsenal stadium in highbury . they became tottenham hotspur 's nearest club , commencing the north london derby . in 2006 , they moved to the emirates stadium in nearby holloway . arsenal earned €435.5m in 2014–15 , with the emirates stadium generating the highest revenue in world football . based on social media activity from 2014–15 , arsenal 's fanbase is the fifth largest in the world . forbes estimates the club was worth $ 1.3 billion in 2015 .
in the 1950s some british pubs would offer " a pie and a pint " , with hot individual steak and ale pies made easily on the premises by the proprietor 's wife during the lunchtime opening hours . the ploughman 's lunch became popular in the late 1960s . in the late 1960s " chicken in a basket " , a portion of roast chicken with chips , served on a napkin , in a wicker basket became popular due to its convenience .
in the attempt to satisfy austria at the time , britain gave their electoral vote in hanover for the candidacy of maria theresa 's son , joseph , as the holy roman emperor , much to the dismay of frederick and prussia . not only that , britain would soon join the austro-russian alliance , but complications arose . britain 's basic framework for the alliance itself was to protect hanover 's interests against france . while at the same time , kaunitz kept approaching the french in the hope of establishing such alliance with austria . not only that , france had no intention to ally with russia , who meddled with their affairs in austria 's succession war , years earlier , and saw the complete dismemberment of prussia as unacceptable to the stability of central europe .
high , cold ice clouds such as cirrus or cumulonimbus show up bright white , lower warmer clouds such as stratus or stratocumulus show up as grey with intermediate clouds shaded accordingly . hot land surfaces will show up as dark-grey or black . one disadvantage of infrared imagery is that low cloud such as stratus or fog can be a similar temperature to the surrounding land or sea surface and does not show up . however , using the difference in brightness of the ir4 channel ( 10.3–11.5 µm ) and the near-infrared channel ( 1.58–1.64 µm ) , low cloud can be distinguished , producing a fog satellite picture . the main advantage of infrared is that images can be produced at night , allowing a continuous sequence of weather to be studied .
there has been increasing controversy surrounding pharmaceutical marketing and influence . there have been accusations and findings of influence on doctors and other health professionals through drug reps , including the constant provision of marketing 'gifts ' and biased information to health professionals ; highly prevalent advertising in journals and conferences ; funding independent healthcare organizations and health promotion campaigns ; lobbying physicians and politicians ( more than any other industry in the us ) ; sponsorship of medical schools or nurse training ; sponsorship of continuing educational events , with influence on the curriculum ; and hiring physicians as paid consultants on medical advisory boards .

the duke and duchess of york had two children : elizabeth ( called " lilibet " by the family ) , and margaret . the duke and duchess and their two daughters lived a relatively sheltered life at their london residence , 145 piccadilly . they were a close and loving family . one of the few stirs arose when the canadian prime minister , r. b. bennett , considered the duke for governor general of canada in 1931—a proposal that king george v rejected on the advice of the secretary of state for dominion affairs , j. h. thomas .
von neumann made fundamental contributions to mathematical statistics . in 1941 , he derived the exact distribution of the ratio of the mean square of successive differences to the sample variance for independent and identically normally distributed variables . this ratio was applied to the residuals from regression models and is commonly known as the durbin–watson statistic for testing the null hypothesis that the errors are serially independent against the alternative that they follow a stationary first order autoregression .
further conventions were adopted at the regional level under the aegis of the organization of american states ( oas or oea ) , the african union , and in 2003 , at the universal level under that of the united nations convention against corruption .
after the death of lysimachus , one of his officers , philetaerus , took control of the city of pergamum in 282 bc along with lysimachus ' war chest of 9,000 talents and declared himself loyal to seleucus i while remaining de facto independent . his descendant , attalus i , defeated the invading galatians and proclaimed himself an independent king . attalus i ( 241–197bc ) , was a staunch ally of rome against philip v of macedon during the first and second macedonian wars . for his support against the seleucids in 190 bce , eumenes ii was rewarded with all the former seleucid domains in asia minor . eumenes ii turned pergamon into a centre of culture and science by establishing the library of pergamum which was said to be second only to the library of alexandria with 200,000 volumes according to plutarch . it included a reading room and a collection of paintings . eumenes ii also constructed the pergamum altar with friezes depicting the gigantomachy on the acropolis of the city . pergamum was also a center of parchment ( charta pergamena ) production . the attalids ruled pergamon until attalus iii bequeathed the kingdom to the roman republic in 133 bc to avoid a likely succession crisis .

philips ' preferred name for the format was " vlp " , after the dutch words video langspeel-plaat ( " video long-play disc " ) , which in english-speaking countries stood for video long-play . the first consumer player , the magnavox vh-8000 even had the vlp logo on the player . for a while in the early and mid-1970s , philips also discussed a compatible audio-only format they called " alp " , but that was soon dropped as the compact disc system became a non-compatible project in the philips corporation . until early 1980 , the format had no " official " name . the laservision association , made up of mca , universal-pioneer , ibm , and philips/magnavox , was formed to standardize the technical specifications of the format ( which had been causing problems for the consumer market ) and finally named the system officially as " laservision " .

in 1992 , after a three-year trial of daylight saving in queensland , australia , a referendum on daylight saving was held and defeated with a 54.5 % 'no ' vote – with regional and rural areas strongly opposed , while those in the metropolitan south-east were in favor . in 2005 , the sporting goods manufacturers association and the national association of convenience stores successfully lobbied for the 2007 extension to us dst . in december 2008 , the daylight saving for south east queensland ( ds4seq ) political party was officially registered in queensland , advocating the implementation of a dual-time zone arrangement for daylight saving in south east queensland while the rest of the state maintains standard time . ds4seq contested the march 2009 queensland state election with 32 candidates and received one percent of the statewide primary vote , equating to around 2.5 % across the 32 electorates contested . after a three-year trial , more than 55 % of western australians voted against dst in 2009 , with rural areas strongly opposed . on 14 april 2010 , after being approached by the ds4seq political party , queensland independent member peter wellington , introduced the daylight saving for south east queensland referendum bill 2010 into queensland parliament , calling for a referendum to be held at the next state election on the introduction of daylight saving into south east queensland under a dual-time zone arrangement . the bill was defeated in queensland parliament on 15 june 2011 .
the ubaid period is marked by a distinctive style of fine quality painted pottery which spread throughout mesopotamia and the persian gulf . during this time , the first settlement in southern mesopotamia was established at eridu ( cuneiform : nun.ki ) , c. 5300 bc , by farmers who brought with them the hadji muhammed culture , which first pioneered irrigation agriculture . it appears that this culture was derived from the samarran culture from northern mesopotamia . it is not known whether or not these were the actual sumerians who are identified with the later uruk culture . eridu remained an important religious center when it was gradually surpassed in size by the nearby city of uruk . the story of the passing of the me ( gifts of civilization ) to inanna , goddess of uruk and of love and war , by enki , god of wisdom and chief god of eridu , may reflect this shift in hegemony .
in soil , microorganisms that reside in the rhizosphere ( a zone that includes the root surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking ) carry out nitrogen fixation , converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds . this serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants , which can not fix nitrogen themselves . many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms . for example , the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human gut flora of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity , synthesise vitamins , such as folic acid , vitamin k and biotin , convert sugars to lactic acid ( see lactobacillus ) , as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates . the presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria ( usually through competitive exclusion ) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements .
the international development law organization ( idlo ) is an intergovernmental organization with a joint focus on the promotion of rule of law and development . it works to empower people and communities to claim their rights , and provides governments with the know-how to realize them . it supports emerging economies and middle-income countries to strengthen their legal capacity and rule of law framework for sustainable development and economic opportunity . it is the only intergovernmental organization with an exclusive mandate to promote the rule of law and has experience working in more than 170 countries around the world .
hydroelectricity is the term referring to electricity generated by hydropower ; the production of electrical power through the use of the gravitational force of falling or flowing water . it is the most widely used form of renewable energy , accounting for 16 percent of global electricity generation – 3,427 terawatt-hours of electricity production in 2010 , and is expected to increase about 3.1 % each year for the next 25 years . hydroelectric plants have the advantage of being long-lived and many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years .
more than 200 newspapers and 350 consumer magazines have an office in the city , and the publishing industry employs about 25,000 people . two of the three national daily newspapers in the united states are new york papers : the wall street journal and the new york times , which has won the most pulitzer prizes for journalism . major tabloid newspapers in the city include : the new york daily news , which was founded in 1919 by joseph medill patterson and the new york post , founded in 1801 by alexander hamilton . the city also has a comprehensive ethnic press , with 270 newspapers and magazines published in more than 40 languages . el diario la prensa is new york 's largest spanish-language daily and the oldest in the nation . the new york amsterdam news , published in harlem , is a prominent african american newspaper . the village voice is the largest alternative newspaper .
various cases for rape , physical abuse and murder were prosecuted in court . women , although usually having fewer rights by custom , were allowed to level civil and criminal charges against men . while suspects were jailed , convicted criminals were never imprisoned . instead , punishments were commonly monetary fines , periods of forced hard labor for convicts , and the penalty of death by beheading . early han punishments of torturous mutilation were borrowed from qin law . a series of reforms abolished mutilation punishments with progressively less-severe beatings by the bastinado .
within six years of the official criminalization of heresy by the emperor , the first christian heretic to be executed , priscillian , was condemned in 386 by roman secular officials for sorcery , and put to death with four or five followers . however , his accusers were excommunicated both by ambrose of milan and pope siricius , who opposed priscillian 's heresy , but " believed capital punishment to be inappropriate at best and usually unequivocally evil " . for some years after the reformation , protestant churches were also known to execute those they considered heretics , including catholics . the last known heretic executed by sentence of the roman catholic church was spanish schoolmaster cayetano ripoll in 1826 . the number of people executed as heretics under the authority of the various " ecclesiastical authorities " [ note 1 ] is not known . [ note 2 ] one of the first examples of the word as translated from the nag hammadi 's apocalypse of peter was " they will cleave to the name of a dead man thinking that they will become pure . but they will become greatly defiled and they will fall into the name of error and into the hands of an evil cunning man and a manifold dogma , and they will be ruled heretically " .
all protestant denominations reject the notion of papal supremacy over the church universal and generally deny the roman catholic doctrine of transubstantiation , but they disagree among themselves regarding the real presence of christ in the eucharist . the various denominations generally emphasize the priesthood of all believers , the doctrine of justification by faith alone ( sola fide ) rather than by or with good works , and a belief in the bible alone ( rather than with catholic tradition ) as the highest authority in matters of faith and morals ( sola scriptura ) . the " five solae " summarize the reformers ' basic differences in theological beliefs in opposition to the teaching of the roman catholic church of the day .
the paleozoic spanned from roughly 541 to 252 million years ago ( ma ) and is subdivided into six geologic periods ; from oldest to youngest they are the cambrian , ordovician , silurian , devonian , carboniferous and permian . geologically , the paleozoic starts shortly after the breakup of a supercontinent called pannotia and at the end of a global ice age . throughout the early paleozoic , the earth 's landmass was broken up into a substantial number of relatively small continents . toward the end of the era the continents gathered together into a supercontinent called pangaea , which included most of the earth 's land area .
in addition to the dead and wounded , government leaders feared mass psychological trauma from aerial attack and a resulting collapse of civil society . a committee of psychiatrists reported to the government in 1938 that there would be three times as many mental as physical casualties from aerial bombing , implying three to four million psychiatric patients . winston churchill told parliament in 1934 , " we must expect that , under the pressure of continuous attack upon london , at least three or four million people would be driven out into the open country around the metropolis . " panicked reactions during the munich crisis , such as the migration by 150,000 to wales , contributed to fear of societal chaos .
cyberspace support is foundational , continuous , or responsive operations ensuring information integrity and availability in , through , and from air force-controlled infrastructure and its interconnected analog and digital portion of the battle space . inherent in this mission is the ability to establish , extend , secure , protect , and defend in order to sustain assigned networks and missions . this includes protection measures against supply chain components plus critical c2 networks/communications links and nuclear c2 networks . the cyberspace support mission incorporates cne and cnd techniques . it incorporates all elements of air force network operations , information transport , enterprise management , and information assurance , and is dependent on isr and all-source intelligence .
the most widely used symbol is the flag of greece , which features nine equal horizontal stripes of blue alternating with white representing the nine syllables of the greek national motto eleftheria i thanatos ( freedom or death ) , which was the motto of the greek war of independence . the blue square in the upper hoist-side corner bears a white cross , which represents greek orthodoxy . the greek flag is widely used by the greek cypriots , although cyprus has officially adopted a neutral flag to ease ethnic tensions with the turkish cypriot minority – see flag of cyprus ) .
one must n't overlook the doctrines of galen : in use from his life in the 1st century ad until the 17th century , it was heresy to disagree with him for 1500 years . galen was physician to gladiators in pergamon , and in rome , physician to marcus aurelius and the three emperors who succeeded him . most of galen 's teachings were gathered and enhanced in the late 11th century by benedictine monks at the school of salerno in regimen sanitatis salernitanum , which still had users in the 17th century . galen believed in the bodily humours of hippocrates , and he taught that pneuma is the source of life . four elements ( earth , air , fire and water ) combine into " complexion " , which combines into states ( the four temperaments : sanguine , phlegmatic , choleric , and melancholic ) . the states are made up of pairs of attributes ( hot and moist , cold and moist , hot and dry , and cold and dry ) , which are made of four humours : blood , phlegm , green ( or yellow ) bile , and black bile ( the bodily form of the elements ) . galen thought that for a person to have gout , kidney stones , or arthritis was scandalous , which gratzer likens to samuel butler 's erehwon ( 1872 ) where sickness is a crime .
in 1981 , the muse system was demonstrated for the first time in the united states , using the same 5:3 aspect ratio as the japanese system . upon visiting a demonstration of muse in washington , us president ronald reagan was impressed and officially declared it " a matter of national interest " to introduce hdtv to the us .
england qualified for the 1970 fifa world cup in mexico as reigning champions , and reached the quarter-finals , where they were knocked out by west germany . england had been 2–0 up , but were eventually beaten 3–2 after extra time . they failed in qualification for the 1974 , leading to ramsey 's dismissal , and 1978 fifa world cups . under ron greenwood , they managed to qualify for the 1982 fifa world cup in spain ( the first time competitively since 1962 ) ; despite not losing a game , they were eliminated in the second group stage .
the influence of science also began appearing more commonly in poetry and literature during the enlightenment . some poetry became infused with scientific metaphor and imagery , while other poems were written directly about scientific topics . sir richard blackmore committed the newtonian system to verse in creation , a philosophical poem in seven books ( 1712 ) . after newton 's death in 1727 , poems were composed in his honour for decades . james thomson ( 1700–1748 ) penned his " poem to the memory of newton , " which mourned the loss of newton , but also praised his science and legacy .
federalism refers to the mixed or compound mode of government , combining a general government ( the central or 'federal ' government ) with regional governments ( provincial , state , land , cantonal , territorial or other sub-unit governments ) in a single political system . its distinctive feature , exemplified in the founding example of modern federalism of the united states of america under the constitution of 1789 , is a relationship of parity between the two levels of government established . it can thus be defined as a form of government in which there is a division of powers between two levels of government of equal status .
these representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake . they care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in space , but only as parts in a larger whole . while each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs . in these archaic pediments the sculptors use empty intervals , to suggest a passage to and fro a busy battlefield . the artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order , and this was improved when classical art brought a greater freedom and economy .
underpinning houston 's land surface are unconsolidated clays , clay shales , and poorly cemented sands up to several miles deep . the region 's geology developed from river deposits formed from the erosion of the rocky mountains . these sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter , that over time , transformed into oil and natural gas . beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of halite , a rock salt . the porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward . as it pushed upward , the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations , often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands . the thick , rich , sometimes black , surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow .
ibn sīnā refers to the secondary education stage of maktab schooling as a period of specialisation when pupils should begin to acquire manual skills , regardless of their social status . he writes that children after the age of 14 should be allowed to choose and specialise in subjects they have an interest in , whether it was reading , manual skills , literature , preaching , medicine , geometry , trade and commerce , craftsmanship , or any other subject or profession they would be interested in pursuing for a future career . he wrote that this was a transitional stage and that there needs to be flexibility regarding the age in which pupils graduate , as the student 's emotional development and chosen subjects need to be taken into account .
paris ' urbanism laws have been under strict control since the early 17th century , particularly where street-front alignment , building height and building distribution is concerned . in recent developments , a 1974-2010 building height limitation of 37 metres ( 121 ft ) was raised to 50 m ( 160 ft ) in central areas and 180 metres ( 590 ft ) in some of paris ' peripheral quarters , yet for some of the city 's more central quarters , even older building-height laws still remain in effect . the 210 metres ( 690 ft ) montparnasse tower was both paris and france 's tallest building until 1973 , but this record has been held by the la défense quarter tour first tower in courbevoie since its 2011 construction . a new project for la defense , called hermitage plaza , launched in 2009 , proposes to build two towers , 85 and 86 stories or 320 metres high , which would be the tallest buildings in the european union , just slightly shorter than the eiffel tower . they were scheduled for completion in 2019 or 2020 , but as of january 2015 construction had not yet begun , and there were questions in the press about the future of the project .
the federal supreme court has established that treaties are subject to constitutional review and enjoy the same hierarchical position as ordinary legislation ( leis ordinárias , or " ordinary laws " , in portuguese ) . a more recent ruling by the supreme court in 2008 has altered that scheme somewhat , by stating that treaties containing human rights provisions enjoy a status above that of ordinary legislation , though they remain beneath the constitution itself . additionally , as per the 45th amendment to the constitution , human rights treaties which are approved by congress by means of a special procedure enjoy the same hierarchical position as a constitutional amendment . the hierarchical position of treaties in relation to domestic legislation is of relevance to the discussion on whether ( and how ) the latter can abrogate the former and vice versa .
this steady economic progress has earned armenia increasing support from international institutions . the international monetary fund ( imf ) , world bank , european bank for reconstruction and development ( ebrd ) , and other international financial institutions ( ifis ) and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans . loans to armenia since 1993 exceed $ 1.1 billion . these loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit and stabilizing the currency ; developing private businesses ; energy ; agriculture ; food processing ; transportation ; the health and education sectors ; and ongoing rehabilitation in the earthquake zone . the government joined the world trade organization on 5 february 2003 . but one of the main sources of foreign direct investments remains the armenian diaspora , which finances major parts of the reconstruction of infrastructure and other public projects . being a growing democratic state , armenia also hopes to get more financial aid from the western world .
